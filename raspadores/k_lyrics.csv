"100 Degrees (feat. Dannii Minogue)
 
All around the world 
Anticipation 
Cause here it comes again 
You see 
No matter where you are 
It could be near or far 
But it still feels like 
Christmas time 
To me
100 Degrees (feat. Dannii Minogue)
 
I tell you what you already know 
Forget and ready to let it go 
The countdown has begun 
Whether you're in the mmh
North, South, it's all the same
Let your troubles fade away 
Get ready to love everyone
100 Degrees (feat. Dannii Minogue)
 
Whether the sun beats down 
Or there's a storm around
Whether the snow falls or 
It’s 100 degrees 
It’s still Christmas to me
100 Degrees (feat. Dannii Minogue)
 
Oh, we're gonna dance tonight
Oh, let the temperature rise 
To 100 degrees 
To a hundred, hundred, hundred degrees 
Don't you know you just can't get enough?
Gonna keep heating it up 
To 100 degrees 
To a hundred, hundred, hundred degrees
100 Degrees (feat. Dannii Minogue)
 
Can you feel the heat on the floor? 
Really gets you wanting some more 
Let's make it neverending tonight
100 Degrees (feat. Dannii Minogue)
 
Whether the sun beats down 
Or there's a storm around
Whether the snow falls or 
It’s 100 degrees 
It’s still Christmas to me

Oh, we're loving all the fairy lights
Everyone's got a different way
But we all want the same 
We want disco night

Cupid don't love me like he used to do
Cause I'm broken-hearted way too soon
I let my guard down

Rocks at the bottom, will I try again? 
Romeo still lives in my head 
Thought I would settle down 
When happy ever after'd been said, mmm

Been torn and twisted, oh I swear

Who's sayin' fairytales aren't true?
If he saves me from the dragon 
Well for that lovin  I'd be a fool, mmm

Straight up forgive him when he's wrong
When he's fallen off the wagon
We'll still dance to our favourite slow song, mmm

"Alone Again
 
There's no escape from that choice
We're miles away
So sad to say goodbye to you
Alone Again
 
We stand alone from the day we're born till the day we die
This is the law of nature 
We cannot escape from the loneliness though many men have tried 
To take away the pain we always feel the same
Alone Again
 
Alone again 
Haven't we been here before
Alone again 
I don't know how will survive
Alone again 
Now we're back where we started
Alone again

Last december when we were together 
I remember, when it was forever 
Didn't know, like the snow
Our love would melt away 
Spring went by and summer started

All the leaves have left 
The trees but this feeling still remains 
Seems I'm not forgetting you
As quickly as I wanted to 
Now winter's on its way

Were here at christmas

I know moving on is never easy 
Wish my heart could change like the seasons 
Someone send a happy end to my winter's tale
Now I'm building me a great big snowman
When I hold him it will be two hearts frozen 
All alone, I'll keep him cold
To make sure that he stays 
I am trying my very best 
But now I face the hardest question 
I know festive chants

She got bette davis eyes
Bette Davis Eyes
 
And she'll tease you,
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you 
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush 
She got greta garbo stand off sighs, 
She's got bette davis eyes

She'll let you take her home,
It whets her appetite 
She'll lay you on her throne,
She got bette davis eyes 
She'll take a tumble on you,
Roll you like you were dice 
Until you come out blue, 
She's got bette davis eyes
Bette Davis Eyes
 
She'll expose you, when she snows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you 
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush 
All the boys think she's a spy,
She's got bette davis eyes

Oh I see what she do but I can do it better 
And the talk of the town be true but I'll make you forget her

You've got to lose control most every night
Yeah you see what they do 
Well we can do it better, yeah I'm talking to you

You can hurt or take heart, I guess it really depends

Oh don't believe what they say
We just want tomorrow to be better than today. Hey!

Should I follow my heart, or follow my head? 
Should I jump and take the chance?

And I... When you dance close to me, it's just too sexy

I think you can tell - I see it in your eyes 
Must be written in the universe 
It was meant to be. Missing you just hurts me.

Bah Hum.. but that's too strong!
Cause it is my favorite holiday 
But all this years been a busy blur 
Don't think i have the energy
To add to my already mad rush 
Just cause tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be 
Completions and connections left 
From last year, ski shopping, counter most interesting 
Had his number but never the time 
(Most of 81 past along those lines)
So deck those halls and trim those trees 
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer 
I just need to catch my breath

Chill this room for twenty-four days 
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with 
Flash back, to spring time, sun again (why?) 
Would have been good to go for lunch 
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course till summer time
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him 
No this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree 
Now the calendars just one page 
Of course I am excited 
Tonights the night but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Cause I bundled up too tight 
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards a few calls 
Cause it's r-s-v-p
No thanks, no party lights 
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites 
Last fall I had a night to myself 
Same guy called, halloween party 
Waited all night for him to show 
This time his car wouldn't go, (I'm sorry)
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate 
In a quiet way, unwind 
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot 
Oh damn, guess what I forgot? 
So on with the boots back out in the snow 
To the only all night grocery 
When what to my wondering eyes should appear? 
In the line is that guy 
I've been chasing all year
(I'm spending this one alone) he said
(Need a break this year's been crazy)
I said me too, but why are you..? 
You mean you forgot cranberries too? 
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed 
Caught on to what was happening 
That Christmas magic's brought this tale to a very happy ending

Come, come, come into my world 
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love
Come Into My World
 
Take these arms that were made for lovin
And this heart that will beat for two 
Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you
Come Into My World
 
And I've been such a long time waiting
For someone I can call my own 
I've been chasing the life I'm dreaming
Now I'm home
Come Into My World
 
I need your love 
Like night needs morning

And this heart that will see you through

Her name was Lola 
She was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair 
And a dress cut down to there 
She would Merengue 
And do the Cha-Cha 
And, while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor 
They worked from eight to four 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more?

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair 
He saw Lola dancing there 
And, when she finished 
He called her over 
But Rico went a bit too far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And, then, the punches flew 
And chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gunshot 
But just who shot who?

But that was thirty years ago 
When they used to have a show 
Now, it's a Disco
But not for Lola 
Still in the dress she used to wear 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there, so refined 
And drinks herself half blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now, she's lost her mind!

And heavy rains descend

With a helping hand to lend 
Just remember that death is not the end 
Not the end, not the end

For the tree of life is growing 
Where the spirit never dies 
And the bright light of salvation 
Up in dark and empty skies 
Where the cities are on fire 
With the burning flesh of men 
Just remember that death is not the end

And you search in vain to find 
Some law-abiding citizen

"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend
 
The French are glad to die for love 
They delight in fighting duels 
But I prefer a man who lives 
And gives expensive jewels 
A kiss on the hand may be quite continental 
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend
 
A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat, or help you at the automat 
Men grow cold as girls grow old 
And we all lose our charms in the end 
But square-cut or pear-shaped 
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Talk to me, Harry, Winston,tell me all about it! 
There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer 
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend
 
There may come a time when a hard-boiled employer 
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice 
He's your guy when stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend 
It's then that those louses go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend
 
I've heard of affairs that are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend
 
And I think affairs that you must keep liaisonic 
Are better bets if little pets get big baggettes 
Time rolls on and youth is gone 
And you can't straighten up when you bend
But stiff back or stiff knees 
You stand straight at Tiffany's

And it's a world of dread and fear

Is the bitter sting of tears  
And the Christmas bells that ring  
There are the clanging chimes of doom

Walking away from the light 
Surrender will be my escape 
Breaking the walls of my mind 
I'm one step ahead of the truth
I hear what I want to hear and I hear you

And if I lie with you long enough 
I can see the things I'm dreaming of
Let's go through the ritual
Until everything is beautiful 
Beautiful... Beautiful...

I'm getting a taste for this high
For bending the rules of what's right
When fooling myself feels so sweet 
Reality looks black and white 
Pulling the ripcord I dive 
It's a cardboard kingdom but it makes me feel that
Everything Is Beautiful
 
And if I lie with you long enough 
I can see the things I'm dreaming of
Let's go through the ritual
Until everything is beautiful 
Beautiful... Beautiful...

And now I'm traveling at such blissful speed
No need to think at this velocity 
The things I fear begin to fade to black 
Now I burn my map and I won't go back

"I Am The One For You
 
The possibilities are endless 
The number of things that you could do to me 
Baby, you could drive me senseless 
Make me what you want me to be
I Am The One For You
 
'Cause you take me to the highest mountain
Take me to the deep blue sea 
You can't get enough of my kind of love
You're really doin' something to me
I Am The One For You
 
CHORUS: 
I am the one for you 
Nothing that you or anybody else can do 
I am the one for you 
Am I getting through, getting through to you
I Am The One For You
 
My mind's been working overtime
Thinking of ways I'm gonna get to you
Rain or shine, you will be mine 
And you know it'll be soon
I Am The One For You
 
'Cause I'll give you love that you never dreamed of
I'll give you that and even more
Face up to the facts, it's time to react
You'll be feeling like never before
I Am The One For You

I don't believe you know me
Although you know my name

Are only mine to blame

Just to pass the time

I don't believe that beauty
Will ever be replaced 
I don't believe a masterpiece
Could ever match your face

In every hand that's dealt
I don't believe that when you die
Your presence isn't felt
I Believe In You
 
But I believe in you 
And I believe in you 
But I believe in you 
And I believe in you

And if you ever have to go away 
Nothing in my world could ever be the same 
Nothing lasts forever, but together, til then 
I'll give you everything I am again and again

I never realised the way I feel about you  
My tongue get's tied and my mouth gets dry 
I want to tell you but I don't know how to 
So every night I dream

That someday you'll be mine 
We'll live in ecstacy

Everything would be alright if I was your lover  
One soul one mind  
Everything could be so right if I was your lover 
If I Was Your Lover
 
Another day goes by and I'd lose my mind if I didn't know that you were meant for me 
Under the moonlit night when the time is right  
You hold me in your arms from then to infinity 
If I Was Your Lover
 
And every night I dream  
Hope and pray and believe  
So happy that you're mine 
We'll live in ecstacy

I'd hold you in my arms from dusk til dawn

I'm yours to have ?
And I'm gonna be warm this winter
I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter
 
Ice skating on a frozen lake 
Sleigh riding down a mountain slide 
Roasting popcorn, dancing till the dawn 
That was how, a new love was born 
It's just like make believe
Each night is New Year's Eve
Each day is Christmas day 
You make me feel this way
I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter
 
It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold 
But I'm gonna be warm (ho ho) this winter
I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter
 
Honey, make me warm this winter 
Baby, make me warm this winter 
Oh, oh, oh you make me warm this winter

"I'm Good Like That
 
I've never been the type who's gonna wait around
Not make a sound while others bring me down 
I'm not someone who'll tell you what you wanna hear
Oh you've got to feel by keeping it real
I'm Good Like That
 
And until now I've been patient
I've been good somehow
But anticipation's leaving me no doubt
About how it will be 
When you let go of your fear and release
I'm Good Like That
 
CHORUS: 
Let's move it to the fast lane
Take a chance and love me 
I'll give you all I have
I'm good like that
Baby, when you crash into me 
You'll finally understand
How loving me can change all your plans
I'm Good Like That
 
I'm good like that, I'm good like that 
I'm Good Like That
 
Don't make me have to tell you that I told you so
Cause I know you know and it's hard to hold
I cannot do this feeling, you'll find there's double meaning
To the things I say when you walk this way
I'm Good Like That
 
Just relax, let me take control of you, sit back 
Make you see where all this goes 
I'm in too bad - what u got to lose
Compared to what I'm offering you?
I'm Good Like That
 
CHORUS
I'm Good Like That
 
I'm good like that, I'm good like that 
I'm Good Like That
 
So take a chance and love me fast 
I'll give you all-all that I have
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good like that x3
I'm Good Like That

As soon as I wake up 
I'm starting to think of only you
I read all your letters 
Over and over and over 
I go to the mirror 
Next to the photograph of you 
I know it sounds crazy 
It brings me much closer to you

I know you'll be back one day
I only behave this way

Yeah I miss you

But all my dreams are only you

And wish I could be with you

But I can't get you off my mind

Tore me apart 
What can I do
It's No Secret
 
(You were cheating) 
(You were cheating on me) 
But I was the last to know
It's No Secret
 
Our love was a lie 
And it's no secret
It's no secret
How you hurt me inside 
And it's no secret
Because you told everybody

With the kids jingle belling 
And everyone telling you

And gay happy meetings

Marshmallows for toasting and 
Caroling out in the snow

With the scent of it 
And the damn won’t break 
One tear falls 
Tension cracks the walls 
And relief comes

Me and you, we’ve got some loving to do 
Kiss me once, and you will watch me fall 
Kiss me twice, and I will give you my all

Like two souls should do 
Do you feel me? 
Come up for air, it’s dark in there 
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)

If you do not run 
Stand and face the pain

Couldn't get things of my mind
Though it felt like I was in the ring 
Slept by candle light 
Scared of running out of time 
I wanna do all those little things

Set myself a sail 
New life, never gonna fail 
No matter what stands in my way 
I wanna find love 
Make a great escape, get lost 
Get away from everyone who tells me it's too late

There ain't no stopping me now

Crying all the memories we've missed

Love is a pair of heels 
Click click and you're on the ceiling
You're great on believing
That everything's so revealing
Love is having nothing to hide 
Taking a walk on the wild side 
Love is a disco ball 
Shining on us all

Whatever you do, it will always be true in love 
Whatever you need, it will be always be free in

Here in the moment I belong 
In a waking dream 
The night is young 
But isn't long
If you know what I mean 
Oh it's beautiful
The thought of what might be 
Close your eyes so you can see
Love Affair
 
I am only here for a little while 
Would you like to take me out tonight 
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby
Love Affair
 
Now we've only just begun
We're running out of time
I don't want to think about the sun
No not tonight 
Oh it's wonderful you being here with me
Close your eyes so you can see
Love Affair
 
I am only here for a little while 
Would you like to take me out tonight 
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby 
Don't hold back it's time for a love affair
Take my hand lead me to anywhere 
Maybe there's something in the air, baby
Love Affair
 
Together here, Together now 
In the moment that we met 
Remember here remember now 
It's too easy to forget
Love Affair
 
Oh it's wonderful you being here with me
Close your eyes so you can see

I am only here for a little while 
Would you like to take me out tonight

Don't hold back it's time for a love affair

Never thought I would fall for a stranger 
Never thought I'd be so naive
Trying explaining the strangest behaviour 
But this never happened to me 
I just met the boy of my dreams 
He smiled at me from afar 
Before I could think about leaving 
He was holding me in his arms
Love At First Sight (1988)
 
Now I believe in love at first sight 
Now I believe it can be (I believe it) 
Yes I believe in love at first sight 
Cause I'm sure it just happened to me
Love At First Sight (1988)
 
He smiled at me, asked me to dance 
He told me he'd seen me before
I could not resist his advances 
I know I should see him some more 
I wanted to tell him I loved him 
I wanted to say it right then 
My heart was so full of emotion 
And I just had to see him again
Love At First Sight (1988)
 
Now I believe in love at first sight 
Now I believe it can be (I believe it) 
Yes I believe in love at first sight 
Cause I'm sure it just happened to me

Saying dont fall in love

So I asked myself, the simple question

Im a sucker for romance 
Should I follow my heart, or follow my head? 
Should I jump and take the chance?

But in a matter of time, will it still be the same? 
Can I override the doubt?

Chorus: 
Love makes the world go round 
I hold it in my hands 
But it slips away 
(And I watch it fade) 
Love is a mystery 
I hear it talk to me 
But the words are strange 
(Like it knows my name) 
Love makes the world go round 
I hold it in my hands 
But it slips away 
(And I watch it fade) 
Love is a mystery 
I hear it talk to me 
But the words are strange 
(They're made of glass) 
Made Of Glass
 
Bohemian boys and Brazillian girls 
A familliar noise in unfamilliar worlds 
It's like a million beats in a Parisian heart
(We're made of glass)
From the boy in the West to the girl in the East 
They've been working a sweat in the name of the beast
Where oblivion stops and oblivion starts 
(We're made of glass)

I wanted an easy ride 
I thought it was all a game 
The thunder struck and it changed 
And then I was scared, I was scared I was terrified 
But you made me reach inside 
As certain that I'd survive, I'd survive

It feels like my body's afraid to say
Too much to put into words

"My Secret Heart
 
I look at your picture 
And stare into space 
I think I must know 
Every line on your face 
And you'll never know
The feelings I keep 
Like the man in the moon 
You're way out of reach
My Secret Heart
 
So dreams are all I have 
Because we're worlds apart
All alone with my secret heart
My Secret Heart
 
I write you these letters 
That I'll never send
It's crazy I know
But still I pretend 
Though we've never met
Don't think I'm naive
I know you so well 
Though it's all make believe
My Secret Heart
 
And dreams are all I have 
Because you're far away
All alone with my secret heart 
All alone with my secret heart
My Secret Heart
 
I must have held your hand 
A thousand times 
And felt your heart was beating 
Next to mine 
Even though it's just a lie
There are no tears in my eyes
My Secret Heart
 
If your picture could speak to me 
What would you say 
Maybe you'd just have to
Laugh in my face
My Secret Heart
 
And dreams would be much better 
Than reality
My Secret Heart
 
All alone with my secret heart
My Secret Heart
 
All alone with my secret heart

Never Spoken
 
I know I've said too much
Confessing to my love 
I was caught up in the moment 
Should have tried to keep my cool 
But I tried to bend the rules 
In any case you would have known it
Never Spoken
 
By the way that I've
Been looking at you 
You can tell that I am gone, gone, gone
Never Spoken
 
Sometimes I wish I'd never spoken
Honesty can be too open 
It's not what I was hoping for
I didn't mean to open up that door
I wish I'd never spoken
Never Spoken
 
It was going oh so well 
Still could be I can't tell
Now I don't know what you're thinking
Those three little words 
Were they ready to be heard 
Should my heart fly or be sinking
Never Spoken
 
Well I've said it now
My feelings out loud 
But I don't want you to be gone, gone, gone
Never Spoken
 
Sometimes I wish I'd never spoken
Honesty can be too open 
It's not what I was hoping for
I didn't mean to open up that door
I wish I'd never spoken
vHow long do you wait 
To say I love you 
How long do I look in your eyes 
How long does it take 
To say I love you 
When's the right time
Never Spoken
 
Sometimes I wish I'd never spoken
Honesty can be too open 
It's not what I was hoping for
I didn't mean to open up that door

We've smooved out all the rough edges

A bad combination and the wrong type,

"Over The Rainbow
 
When all the world is a hopeless jumble,  
and the raindrops tumble all around, 
heaven opens a magic lane. 
When all the clouds darken up the skyway,  
there's a rainbow highway to be found, 
leading from your window pane,  
to a place behind the sun,  
just a step beyond the rain. 
Over The Rainbow
 
Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high,  
there's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby. 
Over The Rainbow
 
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue,  
and the dreams that you dare to dream,  
really do come true. 
Over The Rainbow
 
Someday, I'll wish upon a star 
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
away above the chimney tops, 
that's where you'll find me. 
Over The Rainbow
 
Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.  
Birds fly over the rainbow, 
why then, oh, why can't I? 
If all those little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow, 
why, oh why, can't I?

It's making me feel so blue
One moment you walked into my life 
And now you're saying that we're through

Oh it's Saturday night
Or has Sunday started? 
Cause when morning light comes and 
You're broken hearted
We were close to somethin
Ended up with nothin
All I hear is echoes 
Of the words we said 
All the battles they played over in my head 
We were close to heaven 
Now it's gone to hell
And so I roll the windows down 
And I just fade you out

And it rolls like thunder and it hits a lightnin
When you are going under, it lifts you up again 
Right now that kick drum feels like a heartbeat 
And I'm falling for that long lost melody
I put the radio on 
Saving myself with the song 
I put the radio on

If I keep driving 
Keep movin' forward
Cause there's nothing worth me turning this around
I've been hiding these miles between us
So I will keep the volume up to drown you out 
Forget you were around

I really need a love song that I believe

Right now that kick drum feels like a heartbeat 
I'll start falling for that long lost melody
And I'll find out who it is I'm supposed to be

I find the strength to move on 
There in the moment, I'm strong

Like a bolt out of the blue 
Emotions inside me, all over you 
I'm high above the Universe, losing track of time
And falling free 
I can't believe that you are really mine
Shocked
 
Because I'm shocked by the power
(Shocked) ooh 
Shocked by the power of love 
I was rocked to my very foundations 
Shocked by the power, shocked by the power
Shocked
 
Shocked, like the lightning from up above 
Down from the heavens and it gave me love 
From a man who respects me 
Loves my mind as well as my body 
No retreat and no surrender 
Equal to you regardless of gender 
Giving me love that is warm and tender 
That's why I gotta tell ya
Shocked
 
You and I are of the same mind 
It seems to me that we're one of a kind
It's true to say that when love is blind
But then true love is so hard to find 
You respect me and the things I do 
It was meant to be 
I was made for you 
Open the door to my heart, it's stopped
And I'm shocked....
Shocked
 
Because I'm shocked by the power
(Shocked) ooh 
Shocked by the power of love 
I was rocked to my very foundations 
Shocked by the power, shocked by the power
Shocked
 
Surrounded by feelings I hardly recognise, 
I look for explanations I'm taken by surprise.
Cos it struck me like lightning,
Like a bolt out of the blue, 
Emotions inside me, all over you.
Shocked
 
Because I'm shocked by the power
(Shocked) ooh

I know that I'm out of mind
Yeah I know that two hearts collide 
If you need such a suffering pain 
I was there before now I'm here again
Spell Of Desire
 
[Bridge
 
I'm a sucker for love
La la lalalalala 
I walk right into temptation 
And I can't get enough
La la lalalalala 
I'm addicted to this sensation
So tell me
Spell Of Desire
 
[Chorus
 
So tell me how, tell me where, tell me when you want it 
And I'll arrange the stars around, oh oh oh
Tell me truth, tell me lies, tell me how you feel it 
The universe is ours tonight 
Tell me now, tell me deep, tell me in the moment 
My heart is like it's made of fire
Could be right, could be wrong, or about to burn me 
Got me in this spell of desire, desire
Spell Of Desire
 
I know that I'm helplessly crazy
I fall and I cannot explain 
Why I do, it's like a lock and a key
You open the door and I'm running free

Starlight shimmers everywhere 
There's a certain something in the air
Can you feel what I feel in me? 
It's in the air, electricity, ooh
Glimmering under neon lights 
I can see the look that's in your eye
Like a shooting star in the galaxy 
Making its way to the heart of me

Never ending starts tonight

Come on and let yourself feel the need in me 
Circling and we're getting close
Can you imagine, just suppose 
It's a feeling that I need to know
Close to touch like Michael Angelo

There's so much heartache in the world today
So why do you feel the need to pull away? 
I got someone who wants to show me love 
He tells me every day I have his heart

You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line 
I'll cross that bridge when I find it

High time is no time for deciding 
If I should find a helping hand

So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it 
Buy time don't lose it

And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does 
Leaves you answered with a question mark

I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say 
No more ace to play

Beside the victory 
That's a destiny

Thinking i belonged there 
I figured it made sense 
Building me a fence 
Building me a home 
Thinking i'd be strong there
But i was a fool 
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice 
Their minds as cold as ice 
And someone way down here 
Loses someone dear 
The winner takes it all. 
The loser has to fall 
It's simple and it's plain.
Why should i complain.
The Winner Takes It All
 
But tell me does she kiss 
Like i used to kiss you? 
Does it feel the same 
When she calls your name? 
Somewhere deep inside 
You must know i miss you 
But what can i say? 
Rules must be obeyed
The Winner Takes It All
 
The judges will decide 
The likes of me abide 
Spectators of the show 
Always staying low 
The game is on again 
A lover or a friend 
A big thing or a small 
The winner takes it all
The Winner Takes It All
 
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad 
And i understand 
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize 
If it makes you feel bad 
Seeing me so tense 
No self-confidence 
But you see 
The winner takes it all 
The winner takes it all...

Takes it all...

Has to fall...

All the worries, what do they know?

And late and night we're dancing in the moonlight
If I got you and you got me, we'll be alright

"Too Far
 
Caught up in this house 
Trapped my very own self in the snare of my mind 
No more space than a slither 
What I'd give for deep breath inside
Where the chaos has me captive 
Where there's no exit sign
Where fuel the stupid fire with these feelings of mine
Too Far
 
Lured into this den 
It's bitter and I want the sweetness again
A taste that I agree with 
Get me past these perils and to my Eden 
Where the silence is a comfort 
Where there is no one else 
Where I'll be up from under and can uncurl myself

Can I smash all of this open? 
Can I pass the hurt with a little pain? 
I wanna see all of it crumble 
And start afresh and over again 
My eyes are wide open 
But I can hardly see 
Will laughter find a way around these silent tears?

It's not easy taking all responsibilities
Think it's time that we should know
What we really need 
If the love has gone then you don't want to stay
Then hey baby we can go our separate ways

Ohhh la la la la la 
Ohhh la la la la la
Where Has The Love Gone?
 
I thought that love we had was 
Oh so hard to break 
But now I know that it was all give and no take 
One sided love affair is 
Oh no good to me 
I'm a woman and I've got my vanity

You might assume like everything was going fine 
When there was really something 
Deep inside your mind 
Let's set it down then maybe we can work it out
There's no need to raise our voices
Scream, or shout

There'll never me 
Another moment like this  
The touch of your hand  
May me this  
Is our final kiss  
And I don't know why 
You're leaving tonight 
It's so hard to believe am I dreaming 
Or is this goodbye

Where in the world will I be without you 
If you are leaving?  
Where is the love that was meant to be true  
And we believed in? 
Now you're saying that you're leaving me 
Taking your heart setting me free  
Don't know where in the world I will be 
If you are leaving

I'll never know 
As long as I live

So why do I still feel this way? 
Detached and vulnerable 
With the world on my shoulders 
Left alone to face the unknown 
With just a wish for what it's worth

Why is it that the very thing that bonds us together is also what drives us apart?
Where Is The Feeling?
 
If only I could laugh in the face of irony 
Safe in the knowledge of our eternal love 
Is that really too much to ask?
Where Is The Feeling?
 
Love me, hold me 
Comfort and reassure me 
Tell me everything'll be alright

Touch me, need me 
Listen and understand me 
Tell me everything'll be alright

Just tell me everything's gonna be alright

They call me The Wild Rose 
But my name was Eliza Day 
Why they call me it I do not know 
For my name was Eliza Day
Where The Wild Roses Grow
 
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one 
As she stared in my eyes and smiled 
For her lips were the colour of the roses 
They grew down the river, all bloody and wild 
When he knocked on my door and entered the room 
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace 
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand 
He wiped out the tears that ran down my face
Where The Wild Roses Grow
 
They call me The Wild Rose 
But my name was Eliza Day 
Why they call me it I do not know 
For my name was Eliza Day
Where The Wild Roses Grow
 
On the second day I brought her a flower 
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?
On the second day he came with a single red rose 
He said: Give me your loss and your sorrow?
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed 
He said, If I show you the roses will you follow?
Where The Wild Roses Grow
 
They call me The Wild Rose 
But my name was Eliza Day 
Why they call me that I do not know 
For my name was Eliza Day

On the third day he took me to the river 
He showed me the roses and we kissed 
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word 
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist 
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow 
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief 
And I kissed her goodbye, I said, All beauty must die
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth

But my name was Elisa Day

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? 
In the lane, snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland 
Gone away is the bluebird 
Here to stay is a new bird 
He's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman 
And pretend that he's a Santa clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Till the other kiddies knock him down
Winter Wonderland
 
When it snows, ain't it thrilling?
Though your nose gets a chilling 
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland
Winter Wonderland
 
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid the plans that we made 
Walking in a winter wonderland 
Walking, while we were talking 
While we were walking in a winter wonderland

"Wondeful Life
 
On a bridge across the Severn on a saturday night, 
Susie meets the man of her dreams. 
He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn't mind
He doesn't want the company
But there's something in the air
They share a look in silence and everything is understood 
Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand as the rain puts a tear in his eye.

SHE SAYS:
Wondeful Life
 
Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
Don't let go
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life

Driving through the city to the temple station, 
Cries into the leather seat 
And Susie knows the baby was a family man, 
But the world has got him down on his knees
Wondeful Life
 
So she throws him at the wall and kisses burn like fire, 
And suddenly he starts to believe 
He takes her in his arms and he doesn't know why,
But he thinks that he begins to see

"You're The One
 
If you believe in me 
And all it can be 
Then we're halfway there
Where would I be without you 
And all we've been through
And this love we've shared
You're The One
 
If we were ever to start 
To let love fall apart 
I'd lose my way
There are just three words 
I need to be heard 
I only want to say 
You're the one
You're The One
 
In the quietness 
Is where I confess 
How I feel inside 
When you're holding me
Everything I need 
Is by my side
You're The One
 
Take me away to a place 
A time and a space 
That makes me feel pure 
I will be here for you 
I adore you 
Of this I am sure 
You're the one
You're The One
 
Now that I have bared my soul for you 
A little trust wouldn't go astray
Now that I would give it all to you 
Don't let a mishap get in the way
Cause its a long way down from where you're sitting
At the top on a jeweled throne 
And I've dealt with a demon once or twice
And they were left to pay the price alone
You're The One
 
If we were ever to start 
Drifting apart 
Then I'd lose my way
Can you turn to me 
In all honesty 
I need it when you say 
You're the one

"Your Love
 
Open your eyes to the skies up above 
Now is the time to express my love 
Want you to hear my confession 
You're my obsession
Do what you will do but I can't help the way I feel for you
Your Love
 
Chorus: 
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
Your love's got me tumbling upside down
And I want you to know it 
Your love's got me going around and around
And it's taking me over
It's you, you, you, it's only you
Your Love
 
Open your eyes to the skies and the sun 
I wonder if this day will be the one 
Want you to hear my confession 
You're my obsession
Do what you will do but I can't help that way I'm wanting you
Your Love
 
(Chorus)
Your Love
 
It's taken everything I have
To get to here 
You can crush my heart 
At any moment 
But I thought it best you know that
Your Love

"You Still Get Me High
 
When it comes to me and you 
Busy breaking every rule 
We were up, we were down 
Maybe this is something brand new
You Still Get Me High
 
I remember the night 
How you looked in the light 
And electric feels never felt so real when you held me tight 
How you said my name 
And the ground gave way 
Now it all adds up and I just can’t bring myself to say
You Still Get Me High
 
Baby, baby goodbye 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Maybe it’s the moonlight 
You still get me high 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Shine on me all night 
You still get me high
You Still Get Me High
 
Can I do this all alone 
When we’ve been so in the zone, oh 
Are we walking away or somehow getting closer
You Still Get Me High
 
I remember the night 
How you looked in the light 
And electric feels never felt so real when you held me tight 
How you said my name 
And the 
Ground gave way 
Now it all adds up and I just can’t bring myself to say
You Still Get Me High
 
Baby, baby goodbye 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Maybe it’s the moonlight 
You still get me high 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You Still Get Me High
 
Shine on me all night 
You still get me high 
Why’s it always over there 
I can feel it here I swear 
The feeling’s getting stronger 
Can we hold on a little longer 
My heart is saying
You Still Get Me High
 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You Still Get Me High
 
You still get me high 
High
You Still Get Me High
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
You still get me high 
You still get me high 
You still get me high 
You still get me high
You Still Get Me High
 
Maybe it’s the moonlight 
Maybe it’s the moonlight
