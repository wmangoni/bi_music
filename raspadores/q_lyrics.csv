Bring your dreams, leave behind your baggage, yeah 
Everybody high just like my status

Yeah, I want the jeep with the blackouts 
I want the platinum plaque now 
Wonderin' when I'ma tap out
See there's always something out here you don't have yet
I just gotta turn my passion to a paycheck

I went from basic bitch to bougie 
Drink kombucha with my sushi 
Tippin' 20 on gratuity, but if you try to use me
I'm on cruise like I'm karrrueche, got security on duty
Always runnin' into groupies, say they knew me

Everybody high just like my status 
They come and go in the 310

I got a house in the hills now 
Poppin' a pill, gotta chill out
I swear, ever since I came, nothing's been the same
Don't know the fake from the real now
Don't even know how to feel now
Anything to make a name, what'd you do for fame?

I went from basic bitch to bougie 
Drink kombucha with my sushi

No, just me bitch!

You know me you know I'm carefree
Might switch it up living in 5d 
Bitch, kick it up when I rise like phoenix 
They don't know what's happening
You know me you know I'm carefree
Might cut you off 
Wanna see this bad bitch level up 
When I rise like phoenix 
Cut through shit like laser beams (keep up)

I'm sorry but it's silly to me
Now that you had really no idea 
Who the fuck that you were dealing with 
I'm like the second coming
Yeah, the faucet running 
All my genius I was leaking 
You were way too busy stealing it 
So if you're feeling stupid pay attention
I'll repeat it (whoa)
Did I mention every day I slay 
But I don't think get conceited
When I look in the mirror I see my soul 
We have agreed to be the realest 
And I put that shit on everything

Burning, burning, burning 
Thinking I found my purpose 
Make the shit hot like furnace 
Shut the fuck up, keep learning (uh)

Ooh but don't make me snap (do it)
Don't make me show you how I move
When this shit gets bad 
You know I-I'm always
Listening, learning, making amends 
I'm on a mission, making friends
No competition in my sport 
And I just let em win
I can't avoid the lesson
Can't go back to where I been
There's something new and better
On the flip side if you let it in 
I'm too empathetic, I don't regret it
I'm resilient, if I shit on some wax again
Take it naked like brazilian 
Every now and again I just gotta die a little 
Burn a little, vibe a little 
Throw me in the fire bitch
5D
 
Falling, falling, falling 
This little bitch go all in 
I'ma transform, no warning
I'll be reborn by morning (yeah)

I get it, the problem is petty disses and issues 
Cause there's two different meanings when calling somebody bitches
Throwing shade, clapping back, brush it off, and don't attack
All the drama make me sad, I got involved, now I feel bad 
I know the irony is hitting me so hard 
All these hoes got me needing more Botox

Roll in Hills, South of France in my rearview 
Vespa in a dress, draggin' lace through the boxwoods
Only see Chanel, never see what it really took 
Pull up to some custom iron gates, my insignia 
Every struggle drove a treasure trove, got me feelings my oats 
You can't claim it till you know, what you're lookin' for
Don't you wanna see, what you got right behind the door?
Talk is cheap 
Watch your energy 
Got no F's to give but some Fenty sheets
Got me sleeping sweet 
Let me count my sheep, let me fill your cup with audacity 
Once you let it go, let it flow, let it drip down 
Love yourself enough to just indulge in your own sound 
What you got inside your pretty mind, what's in your bag?
Dare I ask, once I opened up, it was all cash

I hope you can forgive me

Far from the bad things 
Bring me back some better days

Lost in the dark, my trauma knows 
My sacrifice tells me to go

Keep my skeletons in prison cells

Tell me just how far I fell

And I know it front and back, pull the hat out of the rabbit 
If you want it, you can have it, ring it up, I can bag it

Unlock it and cock it like Rambo do, then you unleash the fool

Talking all this kinda shit, like, oh my god, somebody spare me

But a pussy grab back when the situation hairy (meow) 
Can’t keep me in a cage, no canary

Y’all never wanted me to be another copy catter 
Would you rather see me pull another dagger?

And I’m making it look easy like I’m working up a lather 
And my teacher is a legend, ain’t nobody on his radar 
I know how to write a rhyme, he's a really hard grader
Can you please do me a favor and jump on the elevator 
Going up in this bitch like a hungry alligator 
Twist it and I turn it like a hate exterminator 
If it’s any indicator, call it now or call me later 
Cause my team is rollin in like a bevy of invaders

"Good Morning
 
Good morning your highnes 
It's another gorgeous day
Another new beggining 
I've prepared your spiritual breakfast and hot beverage
While you slept your cell restored all the organs in your body 
And your systems to their full capacity 
So sit up take a deep breath of golden light 
A gift from the universe 
And bless yourself 
With the vibration you need 
To meet this day 
You are tuned in and turned on 
To who you really are 
You have a unique and important purpose 
A mission your soul has come here to discover 
It's anothеr day of the adventure
With еvery day you've already completed
In an eternal journey that has brought you here 
To this present moment 
So let's honour it
By taking nine breaths and leaning in to each word 
While we exhale 
Ready? 
Breathe in 
Hold 
Perfect 
Powerfull 
Strong 
Loving 
Harmonious 
Happy 
Brilliant 
Beautiful 
Pause at the bottom of the breath 
And feel the magical life force 
Moving through your limbs 
Yes! You are blessed 
Today is a great day
Good Morning
 
Today the value of my thoughts determines how I feel 
If I catch myself thinking negatively 
I know it's only leftovers from the old me
Filtering out the programs I no longer need 
I have a magical vortex full of things that I desire 
And I'm actively manifesting
I allow new ideas to flow to me directly from the universe 
Along with abundance which flows easily 
The more I acknowledge my gratitude 
For things I already have 
I am tuning myself to the frequency of my own greatness 
Of course challenges are going to show up 
Because I'm picking up momentum now
Moving forward on my path 
When I encounter something that doesn't feel good
I will simply notice it, watch it 
Remember to breathe 
And say thank you to my guiding system 
That allows me to adjust, pivot 
And upgrade further 
I'm clarifying what I want
And what will bring me the most joy 
I'm surprised to find the outcome is often something better
That I could even imagine for myself 
I really am that bitch! 
My vibration is a magnet 
Attracting and pulling blessings into my life 
All I have to do is be a vibrational match to what I want 
Find the feeling of already having it 
And hold 
I'm so grateful to be an extension of God
To know my purpose 
Which may not be perfectly clear today 
But is absolutely already mine 
I enjoy this journey 
Feeling impulses from what I'm ready for
Staying present 
Surrendered 
And loose

Woke up with views of the city 
Top of the hill shit is crazy 
Thinkin' bout hard times have made me
And, somehow, I became the boss 
I pick up my check and go 
I got a roof to roll 
I swipe my Black Card at the Balenciaga Store 
I don't make dinner anymore
That's what the chef here for
I didn't always have it, but I still kinda miss

Just rollin' in our mouse car knowin' we were rock stars
Didn't have the cash for gas, we had to hit the Coinstar
Makin' big plans, ten bucks in my hand
And workin' through the weekend
Livin The Dream
 
When we were broke as hell, when we were singin' on the street
It was the best of times, McDonald's, booze and weed
We built it all ourselves, cheap smoke and strong caffeine 
It felt like bullshit then, but we were livin' the dream

Learned how to steer this Mercedes 
Workin' all those hours at the valet (at the valet)
Never let prosperity change me (neva' change me)

We've been going a while
Is it time to cut the butter on a couple items? 
Cause I know you gonna slip on me a couple of times
You should think about it 
Spark, will you burn for another lover? 
I don't wanna waste time, but my flame's high
Don't wanna put the lifesaver down, til it's safe to drown
Everything you're saying, got me out here looking for a meaning
And I know it might be early, but I'm catching all the feelings
I forget that we are only human beings 
You've been giving me extraterrestrial readings (greetings)

But I'm stupid with it (one, two, three, four)
Cut, feel the burn of another scene 
I don't wanna get mean on my sixteens
But you don't ever wanna listen to me
When I beg and plead (Bitch, please) 
I don't wanna have it your way, I want you to have it mine
It's a give a little, take a little, but you only taking all the time
You got me twisted, dot my T's and cross my I's

All these bitches out here 
Moving on the street like 
“Let's just get the bag bro”
Something doesn't feel right
Stories getting hidden, buried in opinions 
Stepping out the door with a tablespoon of privilege

There's blood dripping off your white night gown
Keep sleepwalking the alarm's so loud
Keep sleepwalking I can't save you

Too bad some people like to sleep 
Talking the American dream 
I woke up late at night to see 
Nightmares on every city street 
Somethings that made mе wanna scream 
Can't wake you, make you wanna see

But you just stay quiet in the sheets

"Strange Dreams
 
Had some real strange dreams last night 
And when I tossed and turned 
Somehow I lost my mind 
Guess my demons won’t be kind 
Another crash and burn 
Another pillow fight
Strange Dreams
 
Coffee in my hand double shot no foam 
If you only knew the things goin on in my dome 
Got my inner voice that’s telling me to drown my phone 
Cuz it’s messin up my energy I wanna go float 
Take it back to the simple life 
Slow boat peace of mind 
Now they got me rowin wanna kill me with the stimuli 
Maybe why my shoulders tight 
Fishing for some meaning in the likes 
But it’s fleeting, am I right? 
Wash up on the verge of fiasco 
Meditate and burn another stick a Palo Santo 
Followin a sign conversatin with the shadows 
Til' I see the light then I’m bringin in the altos
Strange Dreams
 
World keeps turning and my fuse burning 
Can’t lose sleep over these tiny burdens

These boys, they wanna play games 
Keep coming to me with that lame shit 
I put followers up, I got names, they 
Only love on me cause I'm famous, yeah yeah
Got shades on when there's no sun
Ripped up jeans with your bad runs 
You don't wanna talk about a feature, right?
Only calling me for the pussy, right?

Never surprised, but I'd be remised
If I don't say that I still get pissed
Say you support me, but it don't mean shit
Never imagined it would be like this 
Crossing my name all over your lip 
Just move along and find another bitch 
To make you feel a way, crazy

Why you talk to me like you never lose? 
Dropping bad lines on the wrong cues

Not another trophy wife 
Wish I wasn't so polite
When you coming at me and I tell you, not tonight 
I’m not a prize to be won 
I do not pull out for a plug 
Even if I did give you some 
You would take my heart and tell your boys

Ooh, when I get you inside it 
I'll rock you all night til the sun comes up
Say you don't like it when I get this drunk
We can do anything you like, we can be wild

I was just doing my thing, saw you walk in with the gang 
Got a new girl and she fake 
You know I don't mean to hate, but you could do better with me
Hey, I saw you staring at me from the bar 
You let me take a hit off of your blunt 
Blurry, my vision, then we were kissing 
I must admit that I'm having a ball, yeah
Wild
 
I drank enough and you spanked it up 
But no need to be polite 
I must be faded, need no persuading 
Let's make the good night
I drank enough and you spanked it up 
But no need to be polite 
I must be faded, need no persuading

Wild
 
We can start out on the bed or move it on to the couch 
Normally wouldn't allow putting your hands in my mouth
But I took so many down 
Now, tell me you've done this with nobody else
Tell all your friends to go home and be well 
We gon' be going, 4 in the morning
Or maybe longer, I'm feeling myself, yeah

I may be young, but I know enough to get wild 
If it feels like a drug, am I in love or just wild? 
I may be young, but I know enough to get wild 
If it feels like a drug, am I in love or just wild? 
Am I just wild? 
Tell me I'm, tell me I'm, tell me I'm, tell me I'm wild
Am I just, am I just, am I just, am I just wild? 
Tell me I'm, tell me I'm wild, tell me I'm wild

I know it, I know it, I know it 
I know it, I know it, I know it 
I know it, I know it, I know it 
Alright
Zombie
 
Everybody in the building disappear 
That's the way you're looking at me
Whispering silly nothings in my ear 
Careful now, this could get ugly
Zombie
 
All night, I give you all my dirty grime 
I bet you never had imagined she could be so mean
Zombie
 
Careful what you're doing, cause if I decide to bite
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time 
They say I'm an animal, that I'm erratic
You don't wanna fuck with me
Leavin' no survivors if you don't believe the hype
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time 
They say I'm an animal, and you'll regret it
You don't wanna fuck with me
Zombie
 
Nothing can kill my swagger once it's on
I eat boys like you for breakfast 
I really like you, too, don't get me wrong
That's why you should make an exit
Zombie
 
All night, I give you all my dirty grime 
I bet you never had imagined she could be so mean
Zombie
 
Careful what you're doing, cause if I decide to bite
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time 
They say I'm an animal, that I'm erratic
You don't wanna fuck with me
Leavin' no survivors if you don't believe the hype
Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time 
They say I'm an animal, and you'll regret it
You don't wanna fuck with me
Zombie
 
You don't want this kiss, you don't want this touch
Better not come crying when it's all too much
See, you don't wanna text me cause I won't write back
If you want this Queen, better be Batman 
I'm a strong female and I don't play nice
Only one I know that has hit this twice 
And it crumbled quick in the morning light 
There was nothing left but Cîroc and Sprite 
Oh, doesn't that sound nice?
If you want the best, you can pay this price
Zombie
 
Careful what you're doing, cause if I decide to bite

Bitches know I make the boys go zombie all the time

I know it, I know it, I know it 
I know it, I know it, I know it 
I know it, I know it, I know it 
Alright
