"Behind The Door
 
Behind The Door
Behind The Door
 
december? 
she made YOU passing the sill 
and closed the door - behind you 
it's hard to believe what you see...
everything and nothing 
cannot describe with words 
words of pain - or words of hope...
Behind The Door
 
you feel bashed and adored by your own creation 
that is now laughing about you 
about your will to live - and your will to die!
Behind The Door
 
you missed the point! 
did not see that you brought her into being 
being...being what? 
what you can't realize...
but now YOU passed her sill 
and will never understand!

you reached the day of your discord 
and cannot understand 
but day will come - day will come 
you will afford 
to be someone - be someone
Be Someone
 
Du hast den Traum mit mir geteilt 
für kurze Zeit - bereit 
Kontrollverlust, jetzt sieh Dich an - sieh Dich an 
am Start vorbei - das Licht zerbricht 
in diesem Bann - diesem Bann - diesem Bann
Be Someone
 
ich weiß, dass ich das Spiel verlier 
zu viel von mir - in Dir 
Menschenmassen, doch so leer - doch so leer 
der Körper will - das Hirn setzt aus 
nun gib mir mehr - gib mir mehr - gib mir mehr
Be Someone
 
gefesselt als der Würfel fiel 
siehst Du ein Ziel - im Spiel 
Entscheidungsmacht in Deiner Hand - Deiner Hand 
geh nicht zu schnell - eventuell 
hat es Dich erkannt - Dich erkannt - Dich erkannt
Be Someone
 
zum Zeitvertreib bist Du nicht hier 
zu viel von Dir - in mir 
ich lass mich führen, hab Vertrauen - hab Vertrauen 
es ist soweit - wenn ich es will 
in Zeit und Raum - Zeit und Raum - Zeit und Raum

you reached the day of your discord 
and cannot understand 
but day will come - day will come

"Big Lover (Short-Cut)
 
believe me - you never really understood 
said you wanna be lover - but you never really could 
never wanna look around - never listen to the sound 
thought you were a winner of your own transaction 
satisfaction - you need - hate you tomorrow and love you today 
no reason to turn away 
even not to sulk, you always used to be a baby in your head 
didn't hear what I said
dominated things and girls you thought you left behind 
back in your mind 
no reason to sulk, you always used to be a baby in your head 
didn't hear what I said
Big Lover (Short-Cut)
 
dance now - to the sound - hear what I say 
this dance will heal the open wound 
don't try to steal away
you never really understood 
said you wanna be a lover - but you never really could 
you big big lover - big big lover!
Big Lover (Short-Cut)
 
why can you do that to me? -to my melody? 
you see it's not easy to see what's inside of me
you take every breath in your life 
(to) become a lover - big big lover 
you take every breath in my life 
(to) become a lover - big big lover 
why can you do that to me? - to my melody? 
you big big lover - big big lover!
Big Lover (Short-Cut)
 
what is your reason to try (to) get them with a lie 
you lied and you never subside 
demonstrate your might 
you take every breath in your life 
(to) become a lover - big big lover 
you take every breath in my life 
(to) become a lover - big big lover 
why can you do that to me? - to my melody?

Breakdown
Breakdown
 
you always tried so hard - but i could forget you all the same 
your concept never happened of love 
it's your manner that betrayed you - and your god above
Breakdown
 
mistrust - the chain between us 
i'm not in your head, you're not in mine
it's heavy-handed - to the baseline - to the baseline - to the baseline

now -you lie on the floor 
the ceiling's coming down
but even can't break the door
this - is your breakdown 
have you ever felt like falling 
onto your own?

now - see the timeline 
it's going underground
but it's your turn to combine
you - say you guard me 
but i've used the time to learn
and now i can see

i'm not in your head, you're not in mine
it's heavy-handed - to the baseline - to the baseline - to the baseline

cause you don't know
that you need row 
sow your wild oats 
your manner is - beyond the pale 
beyond the pale....beyond the baseline!

"Cold Comfort
 
it seemed like it will be 
a never ending time 
got me not pleased a lot 
but made me fiercely cry 
made me think bout the last
time you were by my side 
i felt safe so warm and mild
Cold Comfort
 
but the time flies away 
we had to rearrange 
winning time, find the twine 
and find the way to stage 
it is what we call to quell 
this feelings bout this song
but after all it is my cold comfort
Cold Comfort
 
nothing else took my heart 
than writing down the miss 
made me deal with what i feel 
no matter more or less 
made me think bout the last
time you were by my side 
so this is my cold comfort
Cold Comfort
 
cold comfort... to you
Cold Comfort
 
this is my cold comfort 
for you not coming back
Cold Comfort
 
two years - long ago - you by my side 
but early had to go - my heart is tired 
out of sight - not out of my mind 
out of sight - but ever there

was hast Du mir schon gegeben? ein neues Leben! 
ist es Wahrheit oder Einsamkeit 
Du erwachst bist alles leid 
hast 1000 Träume auf Deinem Gewissen - zerrissen 
die Vergangenheit ist das das was dir bleibt...

tauschst Seelen gegen Freundschaft ein 
doch willst der Erste sein  
Du weißt, daß Menschen mich verstehen 
die nicht mehr mit dir ziehen 
es schien als fände ich mein Glück 
doch lass mich nicht von Dir zerstören 
ich bin zurück!!!

Du machst Dich groß 
belebst dein Leben anstandslos 
doch makellos  
lässt grundlos andere Träume  
in Deiner Nähe mittellos 
es ist vorbei 
das mein ich ganz allgemein 
steigt dir das Badewasser zu Kopf 
wird bald niemand bei dir sein!

ich hab mich (von Dir) befreit 
was ist Leben in Aufrichtigkeit? 
dieses hier in Deinem Sinne

was Dir bleibt ist (doch) genug

"Door To December
 
The saturday evening pass into Sunday morning 
You lie on the ground of the bathroom, cowered like an embryo. 
In your black dress you look like a dirty puddle on this glaring white floor. 
You never really knew what you had done. 
Was not able to realize. 
But you love it! 
It was your inner wish to enter this world. 
To learn what others cannot see. 
But is it what you wanted to see? 
Destruction of this little soul? 
You forced her become a murderer, doesn't like herself.
Frightened about opening the door. 
The door to december! 
Door To December
 
Now you lie on the ground of the bathroom, cowered like an embryo. 
Frightened about your own creation.

In your black dress you look like a dirty puddle on the glaring white floor. 
Waiting until she comes back, to let you know about your might. 
About the might of december!

to feel my pain caused by your lies 
not in command -just of myself 
whence the might? whence the suffer?

where did you get this might about me ???

My Day
My Day
 
i see it in her eyes 
she hates me! - she hates me!
My Day
 
i will not try to get calm 
what i am, what i want will be the day! 
i lay the blame away from me 
she smashed me up in my trustability 
but this is my day
My Day
 
i will not wait for her chuck 
what she wants is not big for me! 
don't want to know what she could do
she's just a bitch - her aim is to smash me up
but this is my day
My Day
 
this is my day! 
did you thought it was my way?
My Day
 
i will not try to get calm 
no result für this lasting remake 
why does she bring this ache to me 
now i know amity is a barren land 
so this is my day
My Day
 
this is my day! 
did you thought it was my way?

What can you see? 
I believe - can't receive
Feel alone - silent tone, 
I belong to the goons!

I belong to the goons!

I tried to cut it out

But not to save me not to help me outside

von dem heissen Schlitten schonmal laufen 
und gib Gas 
Wuhl Staub auf, dass man uns bemerkt

Die Zeit ist schon so lang 
seit der wir wissen wer wir sind 
wir sind 
sicher, dass es uns gelingt 
Wir sind ganz ungeniert 
ignorieren was gestern war

Die Nacht durchgemact 
verneinen wir den Alltag

ich geh durch die Strassen 
ich erinnere mich nicht 
Was wird jetzt bloss geschehen?

ich kann die Stimmen horen 
Kann die Stimmen horen 
a whisper to the whisper 
but ran away - but ran away
Whisper
 
Augenblick der Zukunft 
oder der Vergangenheit? 
Eine Chance fur mein Leben 
oder tut es Dir jetzt leid? 
Ich kann die Stimmen horen 
Kann die Stimmen horen 
a whisper to the whisper 
but ran away - but ran away

Du siehst in meine Augen 
Sag warum erkennst Du mich? 
Bitte lass mich nicht mehr sehen 
oder willst Du eigentlich 
auch die Stimmen horen?

but ran away - but ran away
Whisper
 
follow the whisper 
to the early day 
but i don't want you
to lead me astray

Ich kriech' auf meinen Handen bis Du siehst..
eine Antwort auf mein Leben sind die Bilder die ich seh
Doch in meinen Augen siehst Du nichts und nichts 
Ich hor die Stimmen - but ran away!
