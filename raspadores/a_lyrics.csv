He was working at the record shop 
I would kiss him in the parking lot 
Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop 
Seventeen

He would tell me I was beautiful 
Sneaking in the neighbor's swimming pool
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules 
Seventeen

Hey, those days are long gone 
And when I hear this song 
It takes me back
17
 
We were on top of the world 
Back when I was your girl 
We were living so wild and free 
Acting stupid for fun 
All we needed was love 
That's the way it's supposed to be
Seventeen
17
 
Stealing beers out of the trailer park 
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark 
My favorite place was sitting in his car 
Seventeen
17
 
We laid a blanket on the roof top 
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold but we kept them hot 
Seventeen

Hey, those days are long gone 
And when I hear this song 
It takes me back
17
 
We were on top of the world 
Back when I was your girl 
We were living so wild and free 
Acting stupid for fun 
All we needed was love 
That's the way it's supposed to be
17
 
We were running red lights 
We were going all night 
Didn't care about anything
Cause it was you and me
We were living our dream 
And we were seventeen

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (seventeen) 
Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I remember what it felt like 
Just a small town kind of life 
If I could only just go back in time

We were living so wild and free

"All I Wanted (feat. Mark Hoppus)
 
I was always crushing on the wrong boys 
I was always yelling when I should've been sitting down
Memories of cigarettes and polaroids 
Kiss you in the kitchen of a house that burned down 
I remember waiting on the sunrise 
And I'll be right here waiting till you come back around
Come back around, come back around
All I Wanted (feat. Mark Hoppus)
 
All I wanted was you, let's do wherever it takes
Me and you, we can't lose, I'll take you away from here
From the city that never loved you, from the town I always hated 
Me and you, we can't lose (let's go)

You were always saying I would crash down someday 
I would have to pass out on my friends couch 
We were up all night so we slept all day 
I remember waiting on the sunrise 
And I'll be right here waiting till you come back around
Come back around, come back around

We're floating to the nothingness cause after all the truth is
The only things we leave behind are noise and absolution 
I act like everything is fine, when I'm plotting revolution

So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

So, really I'd better scurry (beautiful, please, don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in the drink? (ain't no cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now) 
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
Baby, It’s Cold Outside (feat. Jonny Blue)
 
I ought to say no, no, no, sir (do you mind if I move in closer?) 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride)
I really can't stay

I simply must go (baby, it's cold outside)

So very warm (look out the window at this dawn)

My sister will be suspicious (gosh, your lips look delicious) 
My brother will be there at the door (waves upon the tropical shore) 
My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh, your lips are delicious) 
But maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)
Baby, It’s Cold Outside (feat. Jonny Blue)
 
I've gotta get home (but baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me a cot (it's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (how can you do this thing to me?)
Baby, It’s Cold Outside (feat. Jonny Blue)
 
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (if you got pneumonia and die) 
I really can't stay (get over that old out)

"Breakaway
 
Grew up in a small town 
And when the snow would fall down 
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be 
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray
Breakaway
 
Trying hard to reach out 
But when I tried to speak out 
Felt like no one could hear me 
Wanted to belong here 
But something felt so wrong here 
So I'd pray
I could breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky
Make a wish, take a chance 
Make a change, and breakaway 
Out of the darkness and into the Sun 
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance
Make a change, and breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze 
Sleep under a palm tree 
Feel the rush of the ocean 
Get onboard a fast train 
Travel on a jetplane 
Far away 
And breakaway

I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky

Swinging with revolving doors 
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me
Gotta keep movin on movin on

"Fall To Pieces
 
I looked away 
Then I looked back at you 
You tried to say 
Things that you can't undo
Fall To Pieces
 
If I had my way 
I'd never get over you
Today's the day
I pray that we make it through 
Make it through the fall 
Make it through it all
Fall To Pieces
 
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you 
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't wanna a conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you 
I don't wanna talk about it
Cause I'm in love with you
Fall To Pieces
 
You're the only one
I'd be with till the end
When I come undone 
You bring me back again 
Back under the stars 
Back into your arms
Fall To Pieces
 
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just wanna sit and stare at you 
I don't wanna talk about it
And I don't wanna conversation
I just wanna cry in front of you 
I don't wanna talk about it
Because I'm in love with you
Fall To Pieces
 
Wanna know who you are 
Wanna know where to start 
I wanna know what this means 
Wanna know how you feel 
Wanna know what is real 
I wanna know everything 
Everything

I just wanna sit and stare at you

Storming through the party like my name was El niño 
When I'm hanging out drinking in the back of an El camino
As a kid, I was a skid and no one knew me by name. 
I trashed my own house party cause no body came.

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, ever showing up when we had to.

become another casualty of society. 
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity 
And back down.

Because you don't
Know us at all we laugh when old people fall. 
But what would you expect with a conscience so small. 
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised.
Maiden and priest were the gods that we praised
Fat Lip
 
Cause we like having fun at other peoples expenses and, 
Cutting people down is just a minor offences then, 
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn.
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn.

Don't count on me, I'll do it again.
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing.
Don't count on me, cause I'm not listening.

Well I'm a no goodnick lower middle class brat,
Back packed and I don't give a shit about nothing.
You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin. 
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing.
Then if the egg don't stain you'll be ringing off the hook,
You're on the hit list wanted in the telephone book.
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion. 
The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion. (Fadingout)

"Fix You
 
When you try your best, but you don't succeed,
When you get what you want, but not what you need, 
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse 
And the tears come streaming down your face 
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste 
Could it be worse? 
Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones 
And I will try, to fix you 
And high up above or down below 
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth.
Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones 
And I will try, to fix you. 
Tears stream down your face, 
When you lose something you cannot replace 
Tears stream down your face 
And I... [2x
 
Tears stream down your face 
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes 
Tears stream down your face 
And I... 
Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones 
I will try to fix you...

Please, wrap your drunken arms around me 
And I’ll let you call me yours tonight 
Cuz slightly broken is just what I need
And if you give me what I want 
Then I’ll give you what you like

Please, tell me I’m your one and only 
Or lie, and say at least tonight

And if you give me what I want

I get stars in my eyes 
Is this love? 
Maybe someday 
I’ve got the scene in my head 
I’m not sure how it ends 
Is it love? 
Maybe one day 
So don’t turn on the lights 
I’ll give you what you like 
(I’ll give you what you like)
Give You What You Like
 
I’ll give you one last chance to hold me 
If you give me one last cigarette 
By now, it’s early in the morning 
Now that I gave you what you want 
All I want is to forget

A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break 
It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife 
And isn't it ironic, don't you think?

When I'm with you I feel the room spin round

Move along, move along just to make it through

Please, tell me what is taking place 
Cause I can't seem to find a trace
Guess it must have got erased somehow 
Probably cause I always forget
Everytime someone tells me their name 
It's always gotta be the same
My World
 
(In my world) never wore cover-up 
Always beat the boys up 
Grew up in a five thousand population town 
Made my money by cutting grass 
Got fired by fried chicken ass 
All in a small town, Napanee
My World
 
You know I always stay up without sleeping 
And think to myself 
Where do I belong forever 
In whose arms, the time and place?
My World
 
Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way 
I may switch off and go in a daydream 
In this head my thoughts are deep 
But sometimes I can't even speak
Would someone be and not pretend? 
I'm off again in my world
My World
 
I never spend less than an hour 
Washing my hair in the shower 
It always takes five hours to make it straight 
So I'll braid it in a zillion braids
Though it may take all friggen day 
There's nothing else better to do anyway
My World
 
When you're all alone in the lands of forever
Lay under the milky way 
On and on, it's gettin' too late out
I'm not in love this time, this night
My World
 
Can't help it if I space in a daze
My eyes tune out the other way 
I may switch off and go in a daydream

Party it up, but don't fall down
Don't get caught, sneak out of the house

"Oh Holy Night
 
O holy night, 
The stars are brightly shining; 
It is the night of 
Our dear savior's birth!
Long lay the world 
In sin and error pining, 
Till he appeared 
And the soul felt its worth. 
A thrill of hope, 
The weary world rejoices, 
For yonder breaks 
A new and glorious morn.
Oh Holy Night
 
Fall on your knees, 
O hear the angel voices! 
O night divine, 
O night when christ was born! 
O night divine, o night, 
O night divine!
Oh Holy Night
 
Truly he taught us 
To love one another; 
His law is love and 
His gospel is peace. 
Chains shall he break 
For the slave is our brother 
And in his name
Oh Holy Night
 
All oppression shall cease. 
Sweet hymns of joy in 
Grateful chorus raise we, 
Let all within us 
Praise his holy name! 
Christ is the king 
Then already already praises we 
His pow'r and glory evermore proclaim
His pow'r and glory
Evermore proclaim

He was a boy, she was a girl 
Can I make it any more obvious? 
He was a punk, she did ballet 
What more can I say?
Sk8er Boi
 
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well 
But all of her friends stuck up their nose 
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
Sk8er Boi
 
He was a skater boy, she said: See you later, boy 
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space 
She needed to come back down to Earth
Sk8er Boi
 
Five years from now, she sits at home 
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees? 
Skater boy rocking up MTV
Sk8er Boi
 
She calls up her friends, they already know 
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd 
Looks up at the man that she turned down
Sk8er Boi
 
He was a skater boy, she said: See you later, boy 
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends 
This is how the story ends

Too bad that you couldn't see
I see the man that boy could be 
There is more than meets the eye 
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious? 
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

I'm with the skater boy, I said: See you later, boy
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at our studio singing the song we wrote

I know i'll never have him
But I'm there when you're not over his friend
I listen when you come to me 
But cuz of who he is you don't have the time to see
The Other Guy
 
I really feel the way you feel 
Just cuz it's him don't mean it's not real
Your always sayin' your love's true
I listen but i can't say the same for you
The Other Guy
 
What I offer's unreturned
You don't have time to see me burn
You've so far failed to see
How much you're affecting me
The Other Guy
 
When you think of him 
I'm thinkin' of the other guy
I'm in love to
He's constantly on my mind
If you weren't shared by blood
Then would you have the time 
I don't get to choose
Who i dream of at night 
You tell me how you feel 
I feel the same way with the other guy 
So bad its not real 
You can't make me cover it up, you know i really try
You can see by my skin 
I shiver and shake and i follow him with my eyes 
I'm nervous and i know it's a sin
But seein' him drives me wild inside
The Other Guy
 
If it was another 
Maybe not your brother 
Would it be ok to let him drive me wild? 
But then lookin' back
You've always turned your back
Would it be ok to listen to my smile?
The Other Guy
 
Your convinced 
He's so unperfect
But i'm convinced
That it's worth it
The Other Guy
 
I listen to you goin on and on 
Bout how you and that boy got it on 
You don't have time to listen to me
I'm in love but you can't see
I don't have opinions you just talk
But with me you tell me i'm stupid to feel what i feel
I can't run away you only let me walk
Come on now girl, you ain't bein' real

How come when the media stops covering 
And there's a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling 
And assume that its really all love again, nah 
See we don't have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before it's never too late to start
You probably think that it's too far to even have to care
Well take a look at where you live what if it happened there? 
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within 
And we can be the reason that they see their flag rise again

Cause everytime you said they loved you
Left and took it back 
Took it back
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)
 
Taken hostage 
Cut your tongue 
They make you watch as 
The world slips by you 
Chasing something 
You’re crying out, crying out, oh
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)
 
They say it’s weakness 
But you’re just an angel with your wings clipped 
Someone came and took all of your secrets 
Now you can’t fly away, now you can't fly away, eyy
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)
 
They say it’s madness 
Future on the line, you’re moving backwards 
Someone came and broke you right in half so 
That you can’t fly away, that you can't fly away, eyy
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)
 
But you’re just an angel with your
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)
 
Got you covered 
Like a body suit 
Made of lead and doubt 
But you’re still wondering why you feel 
Too heavy to go out 
To go out
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)
 
People calling 
In a state for you 
Think they love too loud 
And so you push them all away 
But it's too damn quiet now
Quiet now
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)
 
Taken hostage 
Cut your tongue 
They make you watch as 
The world slips by you 
Chasing something 
You’re crying out, crying out, ooh
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)
 
They say it’s weakness 
But you’re just an angel with your wings clipped 
Someone came and took all of your secrets 
Now you can’t fly away, now you cant fly away, eyy
Wings Clipped (feat. Grey & Anthony Green)

Future on the line, you’re moving backwards 
Someone came and broke you right in half so

"Wish You Were Here
 
I can be tough, I can be strong 
But with you it's not like that at all
There's a girl that gives a shit
Behind this wall, you just walk through it
Wish You Were Here
 
And I remember all those crazy things you said 
You left them running through my head 
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here
Wish You Were Here
 
All those crazy things we did 
Didn't think about it, just went with it
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here

I love the way you are 
It's who I am, don't have to try hard
We always say, say it like it is 
And the truth is that I really miss

First glance 
You nearly meet my jaw drop 
First dance 
And you were looking so hot 
Held hands 
I moved in for a lip-lock 
Don’t stop, baby 
Don’t stop, baby
You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet
 
First taste, like honey 
You were so yum 
Can’t wait for a second 
‘Cause it’s so fun 
Third base 
And head it for a home run 
Don’t stop, baby 
Don’t stop, baby

Now, hold on tight 
To this roallercoster ride 
And if you’re loving this 
Just give me one more kiss 
‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet 
And just let go 
If you don’t we'll never know
So if you’re loving this 
Just give me one more kiss 
‘Cause you ain’t seen nothing yet

My place, you show up with flowers 
Your face, could staring it for hours 
Can’t wait to see your super powers 
Don’t stop, baby 
Don’t stop, baby
You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet
 
Your car, I’m sitting right beside you 
Rock star, 
At everything  that you do

"You Never Satisfy Me
 
Excuse me sir, do I have your attention? 
There's something if you don't mind I'd like to mention
So open those ears, sit your butt down 
And shut your mouth out
You Never Satisfy Me
 
I'm aware that it's hard for you to do that
All I ask is lay down, put your feet up 
Now soak in, pay attention 
Learn a lesson loud and clear
You Never Satisfy Me
 
Hey, you're a dirty liar
You wronged me out for something I thought was right 
I wanted to be left alone 
Not shown around like your golden prize 
Oh, I looked around 
Look what happened, you found out 
You never satisfy me
You Never Satisfy Me
 
Never trusted anyone in the first place 
You turned me up, you're disgusting anyway
Hear that music, crank it up 
Is there something familiar in the singer's voice?
You Never Satisfy Me
 
Turn it down, now listen to me 
What made you think you were my authority? 
I'm awake, finally
Now I'm able to move on
Just gotta tell the truth
You Never Satisfy Me
 
Hey, you're a dirty liar
You wronged me out for something I thought was right 
I wanted to be left alone 
Not shown around like your golden prize 
Oh, I looked around 
Look what happened, you found out 
You never satisfy me
You Never Satisfy Me
 
Now do these word stick to you? 
I hope they do 
Think about it, think about it 
Stick to you like superglue 
Keep you from the things you do
You Never Satisfy Me
 
Hey, you're a dirty liar

"You Were Mine
 
I can't find the reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love
And she's what your dreams are made of.
I can't find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven 
Without you it aint worth living  alone
You Were Mine
 
Sometimes I wake up crying at night 
And sometimes I scream out your name 
What right does she have to take your heart away 
When for so long you were mine
You Were Mine
 
I Took out all the pictures about our wedding day  
Its was the time of love and laughter 
Happy ever after 
But even though those pictures have begun to fade 
Please tell me she's not real 
and that you're really coming home to stay
You Were Mine
 
REFRÃO
You Were Mine
 
I can give you two good reasons 
To show you love is not blind 
He is 2 and she is 4 and you know          
They adore you 
So how can I tell them that you've changed your mind?
You Were Mine
 
REFRÃO
You Were Mine
