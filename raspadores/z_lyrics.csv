        2000 Blues
        
    
 
A hundred thousand dollars 
Wouldn't touch the price i paid
Of the hundred thousand moments 
Of the times i wish i'd stayed.
But even if i had all the time and money, 
It's still the same old news.
Nothin' does you any good
When you got 2000 blues.

        2000 Blues
        
    
 
Ten thousand clouds 
On a rainy rainy day 
Couldn't wash away
All the dust and the haze. 
But i tried and i tried 
To search for all the clues, 
Why i can't wash away
These 2000 blues.

        2000 Blues
        
    
 
If i had an airplane 
With a co-pilot too, 
I'd fly to a planet
That was closest to you. 
I'd set the tracking system
With your safety fuse, 
And set the countdown 
For 2000 blues.

What, what, what chu you want?  
My thing is a real fine thing 
It's a thing it's a real fine thing
It ain't broke, it don't need a fix

Got a thunderbird take me all over town 
Got a transistor radio standin' on the mix

        A Fool For Your Stockings
        
    
 
Is it you again outside, 
Just banging on the front door? 
You say you had enough, 
Now you're coming' back for more,
But that's alright.
I said that that's alright.
I may not want to admit it, 
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe.
Now I don't mind when you send money
and bring your girlfriends with you, 
But how could one be so thoughtless to try 
and handle less than two? 
But that's alright.
I said that that's alright, baby.
I may not want to admit it, 
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe.
Now I'm tellin' everybody
It seems too good to be true: 
Sweet things can always get sweeter. 
I know mine did, how about you? 
Yes, it's alright.
I said, yes it is, that's alright.
I may not want to admit it, 
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe

        Afterburner
        
    
 
When it's cold outside and you want to sleep in
go for a pallet that's so nice and thin.
Zip it on around while it's on the ground,
spread it out and lay it on down. 
Slip inside my sleeping bag, 
slip inside my sleeping bag.

        Afterburner
        
    
 
You're afraid of the dark, baby, no need to be shy.
We'll talk about some lovin' while we look at the sky.
Don't be hesitating, it'll be alright,
we'll tuck it in until it's clean out of sight.
Slip inside my sleeping bag, 
slip inside my sleeping bag.

        Afterburner
        
    
 
Let's go out to Egypt cause it's in the plan,
sleep beside the pharoahs in the shifting sand. 
We'll look at some pyramids and check out some heads.
Oh, we'll whip out our mattress cause there ain't no beds.
Slip inside my sleeping bag, 
slip inside my sleeping bag.

        Arrested for Driving While Blind
        
    
 
When you're driving down the highway at night
And you're feelin' that wild turkey's bite
Don't give Johnny Walker a ride
Cause Jack Black is right by your side 
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find 
You've been arrested for driving while blind

        Arrested for Driving While Blind
        
    
 
Now just the other night with nothin' to do
We broke a case of proof 102 
And started itchin' for that wonderful feel
Of rollin' in an automobile
You could say we was out of our mind 
And let me tell you we were flyin' while blind

        Arrested for Driving While Blind
        
    
 
Then they had us up against the wall  
Hey it's only blood grain alcohol
And there ain't no cause for alarm
We ain't out to do nobody no harm
How could anyone be so unkind 
To arrest a man for drivin' while blind

        As Time Goes By
        
    
 
You must remember this 
A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by

        As Time Goes By
        
    
 
And when two lovers woo 
They still say I love you, on that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by

        As Time Goes By
        
    
 
Moonlight and love songs, never out of date 
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate 
Woman needs man and man must have his mate 
That no one can deny

        As Time Goes By
        
    
 
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory, a case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by

Somebody breathin' down my neck
While I'm tryin' to roll the bones
I don't care I'll just float a check
Cause I'm feelin' my gamblin' Jones
Here come seven, gimme eleven come again 
Love to hideout where I am my own best friend

There's crazy little Linda Lou
With the long and lanky legs 
Nobody do it like Linda do 
At these backwoods lone star dregs 
Like I told you, head out FM 92 
Roll in slowly, you'll be safer if you do

        Avalon Hideaway
        
    
 
If you don't know what I'm talkin' about
Let me ease your worried mind 
It's the place to go without a doubt
But it's a little bit hard to find
Back in the timber, once you're there
You'll wanna stay
Get loose and limber anytime night or day 
Just remember, ask for the Avalon hideaway

Is everybody feelin' good? You makin' us feel good, too!
Now, early this morning I got on that long distance telephone 
and I called my mama. 
I said, Mama, this is your boy, and I\'m way down here in 
New Orleans, Louisiana. 
And she said, That\'s all right, boy. 
And she turned to my papa and she said,  
Papa, our boy\'s way down there in New Orleans. 
We cannot let him stay out all night long. 
She did! 
Long about that time, I heard my papa lean toward my mama. 
I heard papa tell mama, Let that boy boogie-woogie. 
He said, It\'s in him and it\'s got to come out.

        Backdoor Medley
        
    
 
So I went downtown. 
There's a lot of people there.
They was-a really havin' a ball.
And I felt so good. 
Yes, I felt so good. 
Yes, I felt so good. 
Yes, I felt so good. 
Yes, I felt so good.

You could dance all night if you felt all right,

she always dressed in red 
wearing skintight pants, Lord, and how she could dance 
with a rag wrapped around her head.

It's a chemical attraction I just can't slide by
Every time I look into my baby's eyes
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I surrender
There's a visual attraction and she's branded my soul
Simply can't deny it, she has control
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I remember
She won't let me breakaway
She won't let me breakaway
I said break away, yeah, ah yeah 
We were working it though, baby we had a groove 
Movin' to the moment when we make our move
But it happened, something happened 
And I'm not lying bout the pain
She won't let me breakaway
She won't let me breakaway
I said breakaway, yeah, oh yeah 
I want the answer, I want my soul 
I'm dealing with a feeling deeper in love
But I'm helpless, so helpless, but I remember
She keeps saying breakaway 
Something's saying breakaway
Telling me to breakaway 
Keeps on saying breakaway

I heard about the rock for sometime, I know. 
It's easy to do when you feel the roll.
Makes you want to get up, makes you wanna move your feet. 
No matter how it's done you know it can't be beat.
Cause I can't stop rockin 
no, I can't stop rockin'.
Well, I can't stop rockin

Somebody said it's wrong but I know it's all right,
then it really hits you like a shot in the night. 
I'm never gonna stop as long as I can stay.
Listen to me now, can't you hear me say,
I can't stop rockin 
no, I can't stop rockin'.
Well, I can't stop rockin 
baby, till I lose my mind.

        Can't Stop Rockin
        
    
 
I like to work it down low, I like to work it to the top. 
And when it starts rockin' I ain't never gonna stop.
Get yourself loose, get yourself high. 
I love to feel the motion and I'm tellin' you why.
Cause I can't stop rockin 
no, I can't stop rockin'.
No, I can't stop rockin
no matter what they do do do do do or say. 
No matter what you do do do do do or say, no no.

Cherry red, cherry red

This town of killer tits is doing me in. 
Tried to leave once wanna do it again. 
But this one little thing's such a thoroughbred.
I'm addicted to the feel of her cherry red.
Cherry red, cherry red 
Addicted to the feel of her cherry red.

Whip out a bottle of your favorite rave

Ain't nothin' stupid what we're talking about

You didn't have to make it like you did

And I thank you.

All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love baby it's a crying shame
But now I know what the fellas talking about 
Hear me say that they been turned out 
I want to thank you

I want to thank you 
Yes, I want to thank you

        Delirious
        
    
 
I went down to dock number ten 
To see what just came in 
They seemed a little bit mysterious 
I think I'm gonna get delirious
Delirious, delirious

        Delirious
        
    
 
I got nailed in a raid last night 
They tried to haul me off to jail 
Things were looking kind of serious 
Till everybody got delirious 
Delirious, delirious

        Delirious
        
    
 
I fell into a hand of cards 
And almost blew the night away 
Things were looking kind of furious 
Till everybody got delirious 
Delirious, delirious

        Delirious
        
    
 
I overloaded and I saw the light 
Decadence was on my mind 
Everything was getting ridiculous 
Till everybody get delirious 
Delirious, delirious

        Dipping Low
        
    
 
I went around the world till I found the right spot. 
It was ultra sweet and just a little bit hot. 
Dippin' low in the lap of luxury.
Dippin' low in the lap of luxury.

        Dipping Low
        
    
 
Now if you get down there you'll be doin' it right.
Yeah, once you got it you better hold on tight. 
Dippin' low in the lap of luxury.
Dippin' low in the lap of luxury.

        Dipping Low
        
    
 
Now if you wanna break down I'll hold my head up high.
I'm a good mechanic, I'll go over you in style.
Dippin low in the lap of luxury. 
Dippin low in the lap of luxury.

And if it won't I know a flea collar will

        Down Brownie
        
    
 
When I woke up this mornin' 
had a smile run across my face. 
My baby from town just had to get down,  
come and drag me all over the place.

        Down Brownie
        
    
 
Gonta drive on a flatbed trailer truck 
down on highway fifty-nine. 
I had the blues and my baby, she knew 
she's holdin' little piece of mind.

        Down Brownie
        
    
 
Down brownie,  
my brownie downtown, 
down brownie.

        Down Brownie
        
    
 
Got my share and I'm a black hand cottonfield
just to try and keep myself alive. 
Eatin' red beans and rice with the right sauce, it's nice
or anything you wanna try.

        Down Brownie
        
    
 
Now I'm hitchin' a ride back from Brownie's,
I'm kind of sad but I feel alright.
The cold night it stings but I got me some wings, 
I'll be flyin' into Houston tonight.

        El Diablo
        
    
 
Did you ever hear the story 
That happened not long ago 
bout the man with a tan:
El diablo de Mexico? 
And this man played his hand 
And he lived by the luck of the draw; 
Now and then and again, 
Found him steppin' outside of the law
Hey, hey!

        El Diablo
        
    
 
And his fortune he had made 
let him live high on the hog 
Til the day of the raid 
When they hunted him like a dog. 
He was out on the run, 
Knowing he could get by, 
Cause the men killed in sin
were not there to testify. 
Hey, hey!

        El Diablo
        
    
 
He was caught, he was bound 
In La Casa de Calaboose. 
He was tried; he was found 
And readied for the noose. 
But the break he would make, 
It didn't turn out so well.
And the hombre called Diablo 
Bid his last farewell.

Esther be the one that shoots a machine gun 
Whether you like it or not. 
Midnight or daylight, stay out of her sight 
Cuz I heard she's one heck of a shot.
Esther be the one, she's the only one.
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.
And you will feel her love bullets when you look her in the eyes. 
There ain't no way to escape.
And that's when her fever will materialize,
But it ain't no unfortunate fate.
Esther be the one, she's the only one.
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.
If she gets you in a corner, don't let her mess you round
And don't let her blow you away.
If you can't dig on Esther, you turn and leave town
cause if you think she's bad you ought to see her sister.
Esther be the one, but she's not the only one.
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.

Some get the luck of the draw

Hippest chick you ever saw

Wheelin' in a big Seville
She's big cheese with the maitre D's
Down at the bar and grill 
Just a girl in a t-shirt 
Girl in a t-shirt 
Her reputation precedes her 
In every boutique around 
They get down on their knees to please her 
She's throwin' that money down
Now don't get it wrong, please understand
She's barely keepin' up with the rent
But the finer labels and her car phone 
Kepp her down to her very last cent 
Just a girl in a t-shirt 
Girl in a t-shirt 
Everybody digs her, everybody try 
Once you get past that femme fatale 
Everybody knows she's fine
I had to get it and quit it and keep a cool head 
It took me a pass or two 
But her code's done cracked I want you to know
She's my baby through and through

I was on my way down to Mexico 
There was trouble on the rise 
It was nothing more than I'd left behind
Which was much to my surprise 
I turned around and lit a cigarette 
Wiped the dust off of my boots 
When up ahead I saw the crowd 
I knew it was no use

        Goin' Down To Mexico
        
    
 
I'ts been the same way for Oh so long
It looks like I'm singing the same old song

        Goin' Down To Mexico
        
    
 
A fine and fancy man was he 
Doing good things for the poor 
Givin' rides in his rockin' Eighty-eight for free
They could not hope for more 
When it came my turn he said to me 
Have I seen your face before? 
I said: Oh no, you must be wrong 
I'm from a distant shore

        Goin' Down To Mexico
        
    
 
So if you don't mind, I'll just move along
But it looks like I'm singin' the same old song

A Nineteen Forty movie star 
With a long forgotten name 
She was a sexy mess in her pleated dress 
Still hangin' on to fame
With forgotten lines she missed her cue 
And left a glass of wine at home 
She was singin' the same song that I was
Could we both be wrong?

        Goin' Down To Mexico
        
    
 
So hand in hand we walked along 
Each of us singin' the same old song

        Got Me Under Pressure
        
    
 
She likes wearin' lipstick, she likes French cuisine
But she won't let me use my passion unless it's in a limousine

        Got Me Under Pressure
        
    
 
She got me under pressure 
She got me under pressure

        Got Me Under Pressure
        
    
 
She likes the art museum, she don't like Pavlov's dog
She fun at the mind museum, she likes it in a London fog 
She don't like other women, she likes whips and chains
She likes cocaine and filppin' out with great Danes
She's about all I can handle, it's too much for my brain

        Got Me Under Pressure
        
    
 
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure

        Got Me Under Pressure
        
    
 
I'm gonna give her a message
Here's what I'm gonna say
It's all over
She might get out a nightstick 
And hurt me real real bad 
By the roadside in a ditch

        Got Me Under Pressure
        
    
 
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure

        Got Me Under Pressure
        
    
 
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure

I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad.
I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad.
I work a hundred grand scam from a border town. 
Well, I'll be feeling glad.

        Groovy Little Hippie Pad
        
    
 
I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama,
In a Jeep with a German Shepherd by her side. 
I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama,
With boots and a fourty-four on her side. 
And if I ain't too hjigh or used up,
I'll have her take me for a groovy little hippie ride.

        Groovy Little Hippie Pad
        
    
 
I'm gonna fix brown rice every day,
And drink down a bottle of Midnight Red. 
I'm gonna fix brown rice every day,
And drink down a bottle of Midnight Red. 
That's all I need to get groovy,
That's what all the little hippie said.

        Gun Love
        
    
 
She likes to shoot her gun, 
Shootin' at the target of love.
She likes to load her chamber, 
Hot and tight like a black leather glove. 
She's a little freak, but she'll take you in.
You might be sittin' at the end of a firing pin.
Gun love, gun love, gun love, 
She's a real gun lover, 
Gun love, gun love, gun love, 
She's a real gun lover tonight.

        Gun Love
        
    
 
She's so particular, she likes a Smith and Wesson or Colt.
But she'll give you some lovin' as long as she's cockin' the bolt.
Better hold on when she's up to her tricks
Playin' Russian Roulette but she'll load all six.
Gun love, gun love, gun love, 
She's a real gun lover,
Gun love, (gun love) gun love, (gun love) gun love, 
She's a real gun lover tonight.

        Gun Love
        
    
 
She likes the punch deep down in her pistolero. 
Running with the wild bunch, makin' like a Robert Dinero.
She's kinda shy but make no mistake,
She'll shoot you full of love till your love bone aches.
Gun love, gun love, gun love, 
She's a real gun lover,
Gun love, (gun love) gun love, gun love, 
She's a real gun lover tonight.
She's a real gun lover.
She's a real gun lover tonight.

Do you remember  
back in nineteen sixty-six? 
Country Jesus, hillbilly blues,  
that's where I learned my licks.
Oh, from coast to coast and line to line 
in every county there, 
I'm talkin' bout that outlaw X
is cuttin' through the air.

        Heard It One The X
        
    
 
Anywhere, y'all,

I heard it on the X.

We can all thank Doctor B 
who stepped across the line. 
With lots of watts he took control, 
the first one of its kind. 
So listen to your radio 
most each and every night 
cause if you don't I'm sure you won't
get to feeling right.

        Heard It One The X

Hello darling. 
Surprised? 
Yes, it's me again.
I have just returned from the island of Chandelier. 
What am I doing in town? 
Well, I'm glad you asked.
I'm just passing through in search of the ever elusive Thunderbird.

        Heaven, Hell Or Houston
        
    
 
I got a job as a public relations man. 
Passing out handbills on Austin Street. 
Merely an effort to improve my financial situation, 
And ward off a case of the D.T.'s

        Heaven, Hell Or Houston
        
    
 
So farewell, my darling. 
Perhaps we'll meet again 
On some sin-infested street corner in Houston Texas.

Or know when to face the truth 
And I know that the moment is here 
I'll open my heart and show you inside
My love has no pride

The Courage to stand my ground 
But if you want me

We all make mistakes, we all lose our way 
But we stood the test of time and I hope 
That's the way it will stay
It's all up to you, to tell me to go
Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know that

This sudden darkness fills the air 
What are we waiting for? 
Won't anybody help us?
What are we waiting for? 
We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy 
It's a do or die situation
We will be Invincible

        Invincible
        
    
 
This shattered dream you cannot justify 
We're gonna scream until we're satisified
What are we running for? 
We've got the right to be angry
What are we running for? 
When there's no where we can run to anymore

        Invincible
        
    
 
We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy 
It's a do or die situation
We will be Invincible 
And with the power of conviction 
There is no sacrifice 
It's a do or die situation
We will be Invincible

        Invincible
        
    
 
Won't anybody help us?
What are we running for? 
When there's no where, no where we can run to anymore

        Invincible
        
    
 
We can't afford to be innocent
Stand up and face the enemy 
It's a do or die situation
We will be Invincible 
And with the power of conviction 
There is no sacrifice 
It's a do or die situation
We will be Invincible

        It's Only Love
        
    
 
I'm gonna tell ya what it's all about
Sweet thang's tryin' to put me out
She gone and found herself another man 
She tryin' to let me down as fast as she can

        It's Only Love
        
    
 
It's only love, it drives me crazy
It's only love pretty baby
Baby, what you tryin' to do

        It's Only Love
        
    
 
Well after runnin' round a time or two
I found out only the best will do 
Well it's your own fault for lettin' her go
So maybe now you'll take it slow

        It's Only Love
        
    
 
It's only love, it drives me crazy
It's only love pretty baby
Baby, what you tryin' to do

        It's Only Love
        
    
 
Well, it's all over now but the cryin
I keep on payin' the price for my lyin
Don't let it get you down it ain't nothin' new
You ain't the only one that it's happened to

        It's Only Love
        
    
 
It's only love, it drives me crazy
It's only love pretty baby
Baby, what you tryin' to do

        It's So Hard
        
    
 
When the light comes and yu're feelin' down
Cause your baby's out there somewhere runnin' round.
Don't start feeling blue and feeling lonely too,
It's hard I know when that love ain't true.

        It's So Hard
        
    
 
You just can't explain, but you know it's there,
That empty feeling seems so unfair. 
What can you do when it's gone, it's gone,
Cause those lovin' feelings seem to hurt so long.

        It's So Hard
        
    
 
So if you feel like cryin  go ahead and cry,
A heartbreak will cool as time goes by. 
And it's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.
It's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.

        It's So Hard
        
    
 
Well you work so long every day and night, 
Tryin' every thing that seems so right.
But when a love falls a heart must break, 
And it's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.

        It's Too Easy Mañana
        
    
 
Just a one room country shack, 
Lyin' here on my rack.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.

        It's Too Easy Mañana
        
    
 
Bootleg whiskey, feeling fine. 
It's good reason out of mind.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.

        It's Too Easy Mañana
        
    
 
Oh this life is such a scene, 
Ain't no worry my mañana,
I don't care maybe if I could.

        It's Too Easy Mañana
        
    
 
Deal the shuffle in the cards, 
Don't have to work that hard.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.

        It's Too Easy Mañana
        
    
 
Now if I sleep out in the rain 
I would call my ball and chain. 
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.

        It's Too Easy Mañana
        
    
 
Will you miss me? I'm all wrong,
You hardly know I'm gone.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.

        It's Too Easy Mañana
        
    
 
I spent bad luck times in jail, 
I've been blowing out spitting nails.
I pack my sack and vanish when I could.

        It's Too Easy Mañana
        
    
 
From my one room funky shack, 
Nothing wrong with me jack. 
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.
It's too easy, it's too easy to feel good.

        I Wanna Drive You Home
        
    
 
She is an American car, 
She isn't legal so she can't go far.
She got her mind stuck up in second gear, 
Where she going ain't exactly clear.
Baby please, baby please, I wanna drive you home.

        I Wanna Drive You Home
        
    
 
Low mileage without a pink slip, 
Clean upholstery and it ain't been ripped.
She stripped her gears only late last night, 
I don't think that thing was oiling right.
Baby please, baby please, I wanna drive you home.

        I Wanna Drive You Home
        
    
 
She shakes and shimmies all over the road, 
She's always happy when she carry a load.
Another lonesome automobile, 
Something bout the way she makes me feel. 
Baby please, baby please, I wanna drive you home.

        Jailhouse Rock
        
    
 
The warden threw a party in the county jail 
The prison band was there and they began to wail 
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block 
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

        Jailhouse Rock
        
    
 
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone, 
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang, 
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang 
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block 
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

        Jailhouse Rock
        
    
 
Number forty-seven said to number three: 
You\'re the cutest jailbird I ever did see 
I sure would be delighted with your company, 
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me 
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block 
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

        Jailhouse Rock
        
    
 
The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said, Hey, buddy, don\'t you be no square 
If you can\'t find a partner use a wooden chair 
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block 
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

        Jailhouse Rock
        
    
 
Shifty Henry said to Bugsy, For Heaven\'s sake, 
No one\'s lookin\  now\'s our chance to make a break 
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, Nix nix, 
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks 
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block 
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

        Lizard Life
        
    
 
I got the attitude 
And that's all I ever say
Don't have to tell nobody
How their tail ought to lay 
Had a sudden revelation 
The heights that I've sunken down to
And I don't mind I can't find
My way out of this witch's brew
Livin' for the lizard life
Livin' for the lizard life
I stumbled on the way around 
My own reality 
Gettin' right-tightly wound
Past the pale of normality 
I like big loungin' every day
On the iguana side of town 
The lizard love, it mighty deep 
Talkin' way underground
Livin' for the lizard life
Livin' for the lizard life
Livin' for the lizard life
Livin' for the lizard life
I be a reptile all day 
And it's so fine
Ain't no other way
Like a life minus mind 
I prefer reclinin
Beatin' that conga drum
And waitin' for a three-point landin
On my sticky tongue 
Livin' for the lizard life
Livin' for the lizard life
Livin' for the lizard life
I'm livin with a lizard life

Is everybody feelin' good? You makin' us feel good, too!
Now, early this morning I got on that long distance telephone 
and I called my mama. 
I said, Mama, this is your boy, and I\'m way down here in 
New Orleans, Louisiana. 
And she said, That\'s all right, boy. 
And she turned to my papa and she said, 
Papa, our boy\'s way down there in New Orleans. 
We cannot let him stay out all night long. 
She did! 
Long about that time, I heard my papa lean toward my mama. 
I heard papa tell mama, Let that boy boogie-woogie. 
He said, It\'s in him and it\'s got to come out.

        Long Distance boogie
        
    
 
So I went downtown. 
There's a lot of people there.
They was-a really havin' a ball.
And I felt so good. 
Yes, I felt so good. 
Yes, I felt so good. 
Yes, I felt so good.

Well, I knocked down on your door, baby, 
to see if you were at home. 
Your shade was down, there wasn't even a sound
but something told me you weren't alone.
What in the world can a nasty dog do 
but try to get next to you?

        Long Distance boogie
        
    
 
Don't laugh cause it ain't funny.
Look how it happened to me. 
It could happen to you, you could be a fool too 
and it'd leave you in misery.
I guess there's nothin' more funky king can do
but to try to get next to you.

        Long Distance boogie
        
    
 
Mm, well.

        Lovething
        
    
 
It must have been the way that she kissed me, 
made me as weak as a lamb.  
Tastes so fine like french silk pie, 
sweet as strawberry jam. 
It could have been the thing that she told me, 
when she threw her wrench at my monkey.

        Lovething
        
    
 
Shoulda been a cool scene, 
Like honey on a ripped queen. 
I thought it was a day-dream, 
But it must have been a lovething.

        Lovething
        
    
 
I smiled at the way that she told me, 
I just can\'t turn you a-loose. 
She was a force majeure in her haute couture, 
I was howlin' at the moon.
That's when I jumped out of her window,
Before my monkey could cook her goose.

        Lovething
        
    
 
Shoulda been a cool scene, 
Like honey on a ripped queen. 
I thought it was a day-dream, 
But it must have been a lovething

        Lowdown in the Street
        
    
 
Well there comes Lola, out of control-a: 
She just loves those rhythm and blues. 
And miss Ivy will be arriving; 
in leopard skin tights she's willing to cruise.

        Lowdown in the Street
        
    
 
It's a fiend scene and it happens bout once a week.
SO FOR SOME BREAD COME DO YOUR HEAD AND GET LOW DOWN IN THE STREET.

        Lowdown in the Street
        
    
 
[<br/>, There's Jimmy and Jojo, there's Kim and Keith,
Way outside the eyes of cool. 
And sweet M.B., and there's little G.B.
Everybody wants to be their fool.

        Lowdown in the Street
        
    
 
It's a fiend scene and it happens here ev'ry week.
So roam on in, it ain't no sin to get low down in the street.

        Lowdown in the Street
        
    
 
Some nights are lonely, some nights are lazy, 
but ain't nobody try and slip away.
They'll make you loose. They'll make you crazy.
Know what I mean, what you say, what you say.

        Lowdown in the Street
        
    
 
It's a fiend scene and it happens bout once a week.
So roam on in, it ain't no sin to get low down in the street.

        Made In To a Movie
        
    
 
who would believe  
after such a long time 
i found her again 
and that's not just another line
a last minute scene then another 
if you hit your mark 
i gotta tell ya brother 
it should be made into a movie 
but who would believe it 
should be made into a movie 
oh you just have to see it 
i gotta' confess
i lost a measure of faith 
but she held the power 
followed me place to place 
first a rival, then a lover 
if you can shoot it 
i gotta tell ya?brother 
it should be made into a movie 
but who would believe it 
should be made into a movie 
oh you just got to see it 
it should be made into a movie 
who in their right mind 
would spend hard earned money to see it 
it should be made into a movie 
what a scene, what a scene 
it should be made into a movie 
who would believe  
it should be made into a movie 
i guess you just have to see it.

You want to race? 
If you insist. 
At that price, I can't resist.
That's right, that's right, that's right.
Tonight it ain't right,
I got to have me a week. 
But I'll be back for you, Jack,
and I'll let the machine speak.
That's right, that's right, that's right.
Showdown? You bet. 
And I haven't saddled my pony yet.
Have mercy, Miss Percy. 
I done put the coon tune on this bet. 
That's right, that's right, that's right.

        Master Of Spark
        
    
 
High class Slim came floatin' in 
down from the county line. 
Just gettin' right on Saturday night, 
ridin' with some friends of mine.
They invited me just to come and see 
just what was on their minds 
and then I took my first long look 
at the Master of Sparks on high.

        Master Of Spark
        
    
 
In the back of Jimmy's Mack
stood a round steel cage 
welded into shape by Slim, 
made out of sucker gauge. 
How fine, they cried, now with you inside, 
strapped in there safe and sound. 
I thought, my-o-my, how the sparks will fly 
if that thing ever hit the ground.

        Master Of Spark
        
    
 
Slim was so pleased when I had eased 
into his trap of death. 
He had slammed the door but I said no more 
and I thought I'd breathed my last breath.
We was out in the sticks down Highway Six 
and the crowd was just about right. 
The speed was too, so out I flew 
like a stick of rollin' dynamite.

        Master Of Spark
        
    
 
When I hit the ground you could hear the sound 
and see the sparks a country mile. 
End over end I began to spin 
but the ball started runnin' wild.
But it was too late as I met my fate 
and the ball started gettin' hot.
But through the sparks and the flame I knew that the claim 
of the Master of Sparks was gone.

        Mexican Blackbird
        
    
 
If you're down in Acuna and you ain't up to being alone
don't spend all your money on just any honey that's grown.
Go find the Mexican blackbird and send all your troubles back home.

        Mexican Blackbird
        
    
 
They all call her her puta \'cause no one really knows her name. 
She works the cantina, dancin' and a-lovin's her trade.
Her mama was Mez'can and her daddy was the ace of spades.

        Mexican Blackbird
        
    
 
Oh, let's drive that old Chrysler down to Mexico, boy.
Said, keep your hands on the wheel there. 
Oh, it sure is fine, ain't it?
Now, ya got it! Hand me another one of them brews from back there. 
Oh, this is gonna be so good.

        Mexican Blackbird
        
    
 
Mm, she's hot as a pepper but smooth as a Mexican brew.
So head for the border and put in an order or two. 
The wings of the blackbird will spread like an eagle for you.

        Mexican Blackbird
        
    
 
Oh, one more time, 
can you roll me another Bull Durham, please? 
Can't you do it with one hand, boy?

        Old Man
        
    
 
Old man sleepin' the hot day away
While he dreams a thousand yesterdays 
Cause he's had so many come his way
All he cares about is somewhere to lay his head tomorrow

        Old Man
        
    
 
Old man sits and thinks about his home 
Doesn't matter cause he's all alone
What he'd give to get back on his own
Curses his body cause it's old and it gives no transportation
He sits in his one room shack alone but it provides no consolation

        Old Man
        
    
 
What a shame 
His time is nearin
His eyes won't let him see
The skies are clearin
Someone tells him 
Without his hearin
It's no news to those who've been around
While things are changin

        Over You
        
    
 
A chili wind is blowing 
And I'm all covered up
With despair and desperation 
And it just won't let me up
It's come in time to face the truth
And somehow I got to find the strength to move 
I gotta get up and get over you

        Over You
        
    
 
Another dawn it breaking 
And the people pass me by 
And they don't know how hard I'm making
And there ain't no place to hide
I've got to find some resistance, forgetting your existence
I've got to get up and get over you

        Over You
        
    
 
If I could have one more chance 
With you by my side 
You know I would take back that moment 
When we said goodbye, oh, yeah

        Over You
        
    
 
A chili wind is still blowing 
And the Sun it going down 
And the streets are all in tears 
And there not a soul around 
It's coming time to face the truth
And it's so hard to say I I gotta to do
Somehow I got to get up and get over you 
Ooh man ooo hey get over you hey get over you 
I gotta get over you I gotta get over you oh

        Pan Am Highway Blues
        
    
 
I've gotten good at missin' her
I practice all the time 
While I drive the Pan Am highway thru 
With that cactus friend of mine 
It's gettin' hard to see the white line rollin' by
I can't forget her memory deep inside

        Pan Am Highway Blues
        
    
 
I dropped a bundle down in Panama 
But the loss didn't do me no good 
Spendin' cash and talkin' trash
Don't do it like it should
I realized I just couldn't buy her smile
I'll keep tryin' on that Pan Am mile by mile

        Pan Am Highway Blues
        
    
 
If she'd meet me in San Salvador
I'd buy her a drink or two
We'd talk about our used to be
And ride on to Peru 
The time to get it right is here and now 
If she won't I'll move on anyhow

        Party On The Patio
        
    
 
I found an empty house in my neighborhood, 
I knew that wer shouldn't but I thought we could.
Knew it wouldn't be hard to slide into the backyard,
Called all my friends and slipped a hundred to the guard. 
We turned on the radio and had a party on the patio.

        Party On The Patio
        
    
 
Betty's in the sauna and she's getting kind of hot,
Mary's in the icebox wishin' she was not.
Connie's in the whirlpool, Jimmy's tryin' to be cool,
Libby's in the bushes cause she's nobody's fool.
We turned the lights down low and had a party on the patio.

        Party On The Patio
        
    
 
Heard the cops are coming so we tried to jump the fence, 
Mary didn't make it and we haven't seen her since.
Connie had another drink, Jimmy simply couldn't think,
Billy G. was passed out underneath the sink. 
But everybody's gonna show for another party on the patio.

        PCH
        
    
 
I was out on the coastline 
Getting a little shake 
Do it every day 
for mercy sake 
Sometime surf's up
Sometimes it's flat
Eatin' up asphalt
Prowlin' like a tomcat
Stunned at what I see 
Should I stay or should I leave 
Too much, not enough PCH 
Too much, not enough PCH 
Feelin' kind of free
By the deep blue sea 
A true blood blue slud 
Hangin' on me
Wanna head north 
But I might go south 
Can't make up my mind
Cause I'm thinking like Brian
I'm hangin' in and out
I'm pullin' up cause it's about
Too much, not enough PCH 
Too much, not enough PCH

        Pearl Necklace
        
    
 
She's really upset with me again,
I didn't give her what she likes.
I don't know what to tell her,
Don't know what to say.
Everything got funky last night.

        Pearl Necklace
        
    
 
She was really bombed, 
And I was really blown away, 
Until I asked her what she wanted, 
And this is what she had to say: 
A pearl necklace. 
She wanna pearl necklace. 
She wanna pearl necklace.

        Pearl Necklace
        
    
 
She gets a charge out of bein' so weird,
Digs gettin' downright strange.
But I can keep a handle on anything, 
Just this side of deranged.

        Pearl Necklace
        
    
 
She was gettin' bombed,
And I was gettin' blown away,
And she held it in her hand  
And this is what she had to say: 
A pearl necklace. 
She wanna pearl necklace. 
She wanna pearl necklace.

        Pearl Necklace
        
    
 
She's so cold, as pure as the driven slush.
And that's not jewelry she's talkin'about, [see notes

It really don't cost that much.

And I was gettin' blown away,
And she took it in her hand,

I been stuck, so I asked her why 
She gave me acupuncture as her alibi 
Shook my soul, and stole my dough 
Left my conditional, a deep dark hole

I get nailed every now and then 
I get my mojo working but I'm pinned again
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts

I'm getting pricked around and punctureated

I met a girl with a black cigar, and a salt lick in her hand 
She settled down into a quiet room 
And she started to strike up the band 
She had a time gettin' down to work, with a salt lick in her hand
She ran right in and jumped into my lap, with a salt lick in her hand 
She let me know what was on her mind 
And said I want to play with your band

She walked out on me yeah the other day 
And I haven't seen her round till then?

Gettin' on with the folks, havin' some Coke
and coolin' off in the shade.

My tempature had risen again, 
and it must have been a hundred and ten.

        Sheik
        
    
 
I took a boat that couldn't float
to Rio de Janeiro. 
So with my scuba I swam to Cuba 
but I'll be gone tomorrow.

        She Loves My Automobile
        
    
 
She don't love me, she love my automobile.
She don't love me, she love my automobile.
Well she would do anything just to slide behind the wheel. 
She said what's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down?
She said what's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down?
I said honey why don't you ask me when we get to the outskirts of town.
Well now she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk.
Well she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk,
Long as she got the keys and there's a spare wheel in her trunk.

        She's A Heartbreaker
        
    
 
She used to drive a beat up pickup 
Down around San Antone 
Stealin' the heart of every guy in town
Includin' the one I own
But this sweet young thing of seventeen 
Would sting you with the lovesick blues 
Just a blonde haired blue eyed picture of sin 
Lookin' for someone to use
She's a lover n fighter, she's a wild bull rider
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs 
Well I heard she got down in Beaumont 
And she wound up in El Paso 
She was tuff as a boot and thin as a rail 
And she could step to the cotton eyed Joe 
If you run across this flagrant fuzzy 
Slip in and get her while you can 
Cause before too long she'll be good as gone
And runnin' with another man
She's a lover n fighter, she's a wild bull rider
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs

        She's Just Killing Me
        
    
 
Everything about her was natural 
Everything about her was cool 
But I'm a little partial for beautiful girls
Even if they blood runs blue 
I think I see her 
I think I want her 
I think I love her 
She's just killing me
I think she's killing me
Her castanets are enormous 
Her bongo beat absolute 
And when she doin' midnite performances
She's got a secret somethin' to boot
I think I see her 
I think I want her 
Oh, I think I love her 
But she's just killing me
I think she's killing me
Miss Satanic Pandemonia 
Don't get any lower or slower
What you see is what you get conmigo 
And the bonus of an albino boa 
I think I see her 
I think I want her 
Yes, I think I love her 
She's just killing me
She's just killing me
(That's some time I had)
I think I see her 
I know I love her 
Yes, I might love her 
She's just killing me
She wanna be killing me

Fell by the wayside so to speak 
Quit my job i'm a lazy slob
Never lift a finger cept for my heart throb
I\'m a sinpusher, hangin\' on the on the dldown low 
Just a sinpusher, kinda like heaven or hell 
I want a bit of everything 
I'm wanted by the law

I guess i want it all

        Sleeping Bag
        
    
 
When it's cold outside and you want to sleep in,
Go for a pallet that's nice and thin.
Zip it on around while it's on the ground,
Spread it out and lay it on down. 
Slip inside my sleeping bag, 
Slip inside my sleeping bag.

        Sleeping Bag
        
    
 
You're afraid of the dark, baby, don't be shy.
We'll talk about some lovin' while we look at the sky.
Don't be hesitating, it'll be alright,
We'll tuck it in until it's clean out of sight.
Slip inside my sleeping bag, 
Slip inside my sleeping bag.

        Sleeping Bag
        
    
 
Let's go out to egypt cause it's in the plan,
Sleep beside the pharoahs in the shifting sand. 
We'll look at some pyramids and check out some heads.
Oh, we'll whip out our mattress cause there ain't no beds.
Slip inside my sleeping bag, 
Slip inside my sleeping bag.

A monster can't live unless it's fed

And soon it's gonna leave the world blank
And we'll all be erased by the squank

        Sure Got Cold After The Rain Fell
        
    
 
Rain fell this mornin  make me feel so bad
On account of my baby walked off with another man. 
Like takin' eyesight from the blind man and money from the poor
That woman took my lovin' and walked on out that door.
And it sure got cold after the rain fell 
Not from the sky, from my eye 
Somebody, can you tell me just what make a man feel this way? 
Like river without its water, like night without a day 
And it sure nuff got cold after the rain fell
Not from the sky but from my eye 
If you're home early in the mornin' you hear that rain to fall
With thunderbolts and lightning the wind begins to call 
Your worry's superficial cause you slept on through the night
But stormy weather keep you wond'rin' if ev'rything's all right
And it sure nuff got cold after the rain fell
Not from the sky but from my eye 
Not from the sky, from my eye

        Tell It
        
    
 
Gotta find out what's in my mind,
I'm a little mixed up but it feels so fine.
Why does love have to come and go, 
If it's got to leave why does it go so slow?
Just tell it... 
Tell it like it is. 
Tell it.. 
Tell it like it feels. 
Tell it to my baby. 
I have a feelin' that i'm goin' insane,
I've fallen in love but can't remember her name.
She prob'ly stepped out and she's coming back again,
But if i don't know her how can i let her in?
Just tell it... 
Tell it like it is. 
Tell it.. 
Tell it like it feels. 
Tell it to my baby. 
(spoken: fine! 
So fine!) 
How could this ever have happened this way? 
Well, sometimes love turns out that way. 
Sometimes it's cold and sometimes it's hot,
But it's better to have it than to need it and not!

        Two Ways to Play
        
    
 
Somethin' crossed my mind again
You were in my eyes 
It was somewhere out by Bombay 
And I'm tellin' all those lies
I've been there and you've been there
And there ain't no mistake
We could take it anyway 
But the one thing we can't fake

        Two Ways to Play
        
    
 
There's just two ways to play
Just two ways to play 
And I don't want to stay
There's just two ways to play
And I'm gonna play it right, this time

        Two Ways to Play
        
    
 
Yeah

        Two Ways to Play
        
    
 
There's always the easy numbers
There's those hard ways too
There's those cheaters blunders
It's either one of two
But fortune telling's mezmorizing
In the game of chance 
But rollin' dice ain't sympathizing
When you play romance

        Two Ways to Play
        
    
 
There's just two ways to play
Just two ways to play 
And I don't want to stay
There's just two ways to play

        Two Ways to Play
        
    
 
I can't control the numbers
I can't control your sexy ways
I can't control my inner thunder
It makes me want????????

        Two Ways to Play
        
    
 
Two ways to play 
There's Just two ways to play
There's just two ways to play
There's just two ways to play
I'm gonna play it right this time
There's two ways to play
There's just two ways to play
Two ways to play 
There's just two ways to play

        Two Ways to Play
        
    
 
And I don't want to stay
There's just two ways to play

Hey, look at the hooks 
On your pants makes you wanna dance. 
I say yeah yeah,

There ain't never a catch, all you got to do is snatch,

You need just enough of that sticky stuff 
To hold the seams of your fine blue jeans.

        Vincent Price Blues
        
    
 
There's a rockin' time on the borderline
Between sundown and up 
There's an off-the-wall cantina, man
Just waitin' to tear you up
The locals know that in you go 
And out con nalgas fried 
Night descends, and the fun begins 
Way out the other side 
But, I didn't say it
Oh, no 
Vincent Price said it's alright
Vincent Price said it's OK
There's a very cherry charmer
Oozin' groovin' grease
She come in with the graveyard shift 
A pleasin' teasin' squeeze
El jeffe [sic
 holler mucho mas 
Get some sucker's ass inside
I think you'll know you gotta go
To get some satisfy 
But, I didn't say it
Oh, no 
Vincent Price said it's alright
Vincent Price said it's OK
I've dined at Spago and Eclipse
And Whataburger too 
I've had Mescal with lotsa gals
Along 5th Avenue 
I always shot the best they got 
Dinero no problema 
Ain't no quarter south-the-border
In this off the wall cantina 
But, I didn't say it
Oh, no 
Vincent Price said it's alright
VIncent Price said it's ok
Vincent, Vincent Price said it's alright
Vincent Price said it's OK

        Viva Las Vegas
        
    
 
Spoken: Y'all still want me to come with you?
Bright light city gonna set my soul, gonna set my soul on fire 
There's a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher. 
There's a thousand pretty women just a-waitin out there,
And they're all livin' devil-may-care.
I'm just the devil with a love to spare.
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Spoken: Ah, thank-ya very much baby. 
And how I wish that there were more 
Than twenty-four hours in the day. 
But even if there were forty more, 
I wouldn't sleep a minute away.
Oh, there's blackjack and poker and a roulette wheel.
A fortune won and lost on every deal. 
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel.
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva Las Vegas with your neon flashin 
And your one-armed bandits crashin
All those hopes down the drain. 
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime,
Turn the night into daytime, 
If you see it once, you'll never come home again.
I'm gonna keep on the run,
I'm gonna have me some fun,
If it costs me my very last dime. 
If I wind up broke, 
Then I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time.
I'm gonna give it everything I've got.
Lady Luck please let the dice stay hot. 
Let me shoot a seven with every shot. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva Las Vegas. 
Viva, Viva.

        What's Up With That
        
    
 
Well how much blues do you use  
Before you use it up 
And how many fools take a chance 
Before they hit it lucky 
Tomorrow's wanna be the day 
It never seem to work that way 
What's up with that 
What's up with that
What's up with that
What's up with that
Everybody want a little more  
Than they think they got 
But what you might think it is, 
Might really not be, baby 
Pick it up or leave it lay 
It always seem to slip away 
What's up with that 
What's up with that
What's up with that
What's up with that
Now how high will a river get 
Before it overflows 
And how long is the hole to China 
It don't really know
This is what it's all about
There's always gonna be a doubt
What's up with that
What's up with that
What's up with that
What's up with that

        Whiskey'n Mama
        
    
 
I'm so tired, you on my head.
Whiskey'n mama, you shouldn't have said
You wanted me to be your lover true, 
Then turn around and treats me just likes you do. 
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.
Now i could be right and could be wrong, 
You been layin' out all night long.
You telephoned this mornin  said you'd be home soon.
The doorman said he seen you at the club blue lagoon. 
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.
Whiskey'n mama, you standin' there
With your curly hair 
Just to have you do me good. 
I know you could if you only would. 
Whiskey'n mama, you standin' there
With your curly hair 
Just to have you do me good. 
I know you could if you only would. 
Well, the sun come shinin' on the rain soaked street.
Whiskey'n mama, where can she be?
I guess i'll have to put you down on my list,
I didn't wanna do it but you insist.
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.

        Woke Up With Wood
        
    
 
When I woke up this morning 
I was feeling mighty good. 
My baby understood had to do what she should 
lying near a pile of wood. 
Laying it on some, 
playing with it some 
when I, I woke up with wood. 
I was lying there thinking bout basketball
trying not to lose my mind 
my baby came to help and I let out a yell, 
she grabbed me from behind. 
Laying on it some, 
playing with it some 
when I, I woke up with wood. 
Beauty queens fall in trances, 
debutantes lose their furs. 
But it felt so good from where they stood, 
they were working on a pile of wood. 
Laying on it some, 
playing with it some 
when I, I woke up with wood.

        World Of Swirl
        
    
 
I hit the street running, had an angle in mind 
Looking for a shelter, doing double overtime 
I get a little crazy, but I won't be denied
Gotta find the time that takes the inside outside 
Tumbling, in a world of swirl 
Rumbling, in a world of swirl 
In a world of swirl 
Everything's hazy, everything's a blur
Isn't it amazing? checking outta where we were
It's so unpredictable, at the end of my rope
Gotta skate the ledge outta this kaleidoscope 
Tumbling, in a world of swirl 
Rumbling, in a world of swirl 
In a world of swirl 
In this cloud of dust, you've got to keep steady
Hang on you must, you better get ready 
Over the ledge, ripping the curl 
Riding the edge off into to twirl 
Tumbling, in a world of swirl 
Rumbling, in a world of swirl 
In a world of swirl

Cos what is what and who is who?

He/she just got a zipper job 
An everlasting zipper job
