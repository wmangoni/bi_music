Intro/Conversation:
22 Times
 
Yo son, whatcha think about those Peas, though? 
Yo, yo, I don't know, them dudes just be on stage,
dancin and stuff... 
They on some old Las Vegas bullshit 
They move too much, man 
I can't take them fools seriously
I mean, they ain't talk about no 6-4, no Impalas
They ain't shootin nobody (Shootin nobody)
They ain't talkin about clothes
You know what I'm saying?
22 Times
 
Yo, my man, I got a plan to do it all (What kind of 
plan you got) 
I got a plan that none of y'all ever
Talked about cause underground niggas don't be
thinking 
I'm going kinda ?nino? like Lincoln
How can you make moves when you're always strapped
under 
I plan to read the scriptures, tell you more about the 
thunder 
I wonder what really makes the world go round 
Not thugs, cause thugs go round the brain of a
brother's down
You be in it for a quick blink 
But when you start to sink 
You be deeper than you was 
When you should've stop to think
About your consequence your actions don't make lots of
sense 
Brothers use the wicked life cause of lack of
confidence 
The devil jacked you for your sense now 
You can't pay your rent and
That's no accident, you let us slip so we win
The rest of your development 
You should've took time to prevent
The compiscation of your monument 
Now ya, wash up, and a nobody 
No one blame but your body 
You livin life, had thick and uneasy 
You chose to be involved with no deals and crisis 
In a hole cause of lust and greed
Your mind held captive and unable to exceed 
Come out and follow the Peas, we give you what you 
need 
We proceed to give you, what (What, what)
22 Times
 
A... (8x) 
We givin you what you want

22 Times
 
Yo, everybody's goal is to win
But others gettiing caught up within the line of 
commiting sins 
And everybody seems to wanna rule 
It's so ridicule we gotta find the right cure
We approach to penetrate equivalent and strong 
To wash out individual with evil forms 
Conquering battles in these fields of greed 
Dark faces all around me makes it hard for me to see 
Who's got my back and who will backstab
I'm ready for foes and hoes who tries to grab
My currency, if I ain't got none
The (?) crip to runs to the ones who got some 
The war billows to those who makes action 
The main caption is to bring satisfaction 
If you like that contend you see 
How you suppose to call yourself a real MC
22 Times
 
So what's the definition of a true MC
(Someone who rocks swell and put my soul at ease) 
Lyrics went entertaining capability 
(Now that's the realest, see, all around 360 degrees)
22 Times
 
I'm givin you what you want, want
I'm givin you what you want
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Hey, witness grief through startin material 
You are blinded by lights, had an ego ratio 
God bless you with the gift of only show 
Business but you a careless professional 
Is where your failing will show 
Over indos and end only cash flows 
Makin it big, but yet, you never know 
You will pay in your dues bringin on sorrow 
Here today, easily gone tomorrow 
Feel the pain and I never borrow 
From another man, instead I'm making grand
Watch the Peas as we make a stand

"Abba, Father! We Approach Thee
 
Abba, Father! We approach Thee 
In our Savior's precious Name;
We, Thy children, here assembled, 
Now Thy promised blessing claim; 
From our sins His blood hath washed us, 
Tis through Him our souls draw nigh,
And Thy Spirit, too, hath taught us, 
Abba, Father, thus to cry.
Abba, Father! We Approach Thee
 
Once as prodigals we wandered 
In our folly far from Thee, 
But Thy grace, o'er sin abounding,
Rescued us from misery; 
Thou Thy prodigals hast pardoned, 
Kissed us with a Father's love,
Spread the festive board, and called us, 
E'er to dwell with Thee above.
Abba, Father! We Approach Thee
 
Clothed in garments of salvation, 
At Thy table is our place, 
We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest, 
In the riches of Thy grace; 
It is meet, we hear Thee saying, 
We should merry and be glad, 
I have found My once lost children, 
Now they live who once were dead.
Abba, Father! We Approach Thee
 
Abba, Father! all adore Thee, 
All rejoice in Heav'n above,
While in us they learn the wonders 
Of Thy wisdom, grace, and love; 
Soon before Thy throne assembled, 
All Thy children shall proclaim, 
Glory, everlasting glory, 
Be to God and to the Lamb!

"Abide In Me, o Lord
 
Abide in me, O Lord, and I in Thee, 
From this good hour, oh, leave me nevermore; 
Then shall the discord cease, the wound be healed, 
The lifelong bleeding of the soul be o'er.
Abide In Me, o Lord
 
Abide in me; o'ershadow by Thy love
Each half formed purpose and dark thought of sin; 
Quench ere it rise each selfish, low desire, 
And keep my soul as Thine, calm and divine.
Abide In Me, o Lord
 
As some rare perfume in a vase of clay, 
Pervades it with a fragrance not its own, 
So, when Thou dwellest in a mortal soul, 
All Heaven's own sweetness seems around it thrown.
Abide In Me, o Lord
 
Abide in me; there have been moments blest 
When I have heard Thy voice and felt Thy power; 
Then evil lost its grasp; and passion, hushed, 
Owned the divine enchantment of the hour.
Abide In Me, o Lord
 
These were but seasons beautiful and rare; 
Abide in me, and they shall ever be; 
Fulfill at once Thy precept and my prayer, 
Come, and abide in me, and I in Thee.

Abide in Thee, in that deep love of Thine, 
My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine; 
Down, closely down, as living branch with tree, 
I would abide, my Lord, my Christ, in Thee.
Abide In Thee
 
Abide in Thee, my Savior, God, I know 
How love of Thine, so vast, in me may flow: 
My empty vessel running o'er with joy,
Now overflows to Thee without alloy.
Abide In Thee
 
Abide in Thee, nor doubt, nor self, nor sin, 
Can e'er prevail with Thy blest life within;
Joined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul 
Knows naught besides its motions to control.
Abide In Thee
 
Abide in Thee, tis thus alone I know
The secrets of Thy mind e'en while below;
All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy Word, 
All power and fruit, and service for the Lord.

"Afflictions do Not Come Alone
 
Afflictions do not come alone, 
A voice attends the rod; 
By both He to His saints is known, 
A Father and a God!
Afflictions do Not Come Alone
 
Let not My children slight the stroke 
I for chastisement send; 
Nor faint beneath My kind rebuke, 
For still I am their Friend.
Afflictions do Not Come Alone
 
The wicked I perhaps may leave 
Awhile, and not reprove; 
But all the children I receive 
I scourge, because I love.
Afflictions do Not Come Alone
 
If therefore you were left without 
This needful discipline; 
You might, with cause, admit a doubt, 
If you, indeed, were Mine.
Afflictions do Not Come Alone
 
Shall earthly parents then expect 
Their children to submit? 
And wilt not you, when I correct, 
Be humbled at My feet?
Afflictions do Not Come Alone
 
To please themselves they oft chastise, 
And put their sons to pain; 
But you are precious in My eyes, 
And shall not smart in vain.
Afflictions do Not Come Alone
 
I see your hearts, at present, filled 
With grief, and deep distress; 
But soon these bitter seeds shall yield 
The fruits of righteousness.
Afflictions do Not Come Alone
 
Break through the clouds, dear Lord, and shine! 
Let us perceive Thee nigh! 
And to each mourning child of Thine 
These gracious words apply.

"Afflictions, Though They Seem Severe
 
Afflictions, though they seem severe; 
In mercy oft are sent; 
They stopped the prodigal's career,
And forced him to repent.
Afflictions, Though They Seem Severe
 
Although he no relentings felt 
Till he had spent his store; 
His stubborn heart began to melt 
When famine pinched him sore.
Afflictions, Though They Seem Severe
 
What have I gained by sin, he said, 
But hunger, shame, and fear; 
My father's house abounds with bread,
While I am starving here.
Afflictions, Though They Seem Severe
 
I'll go, and tell him all I've done,
And fall before his face 
Unworthy to be called his son, 
I\'ll seek a servant\'s place.
Afflictions, Though They Seem Severe
 
His father saw him coming back, 
He saw, and ran, and smiled; 
And threw his arms around the neck 
Of his rebellious child.
Afflictions, Though They Seem Severe
 
Father, I\'ve sinned-but O forgive! 
I've heard enough, he said,
Rejoice my house, my son's alive,
For whom I mourned as dead.
Afflictions, Though They Seem Severe
 
Now let the fatted calf be slain, 
And spread the news around; 
My son was dead, but lives again, 
Was lost, but now is found.
Afflictions, Though They Seem Severe
 
'Tis thus the Lord His love reveals,
To call poor sinners home; 
More than a father's love He feels,
And welcomes all that come.

Again, as evening's shadow falls,
We gather in these hallowed walls; 
And vesper hymn and vesper prayer 
Rise mingling on the holy air.

Here find the rest of God's own peace;
And, strengthened here by hymn and prayer, 
Lay down the burden and the care.

Within all shadows standest Thou; 
Give deeper calm than night can bring; 
Give sweeter songs than lips can sing.

We cannot at the shrine remain;

When God speaks in thunder and makes Himself known,

His warnings neglected, His patience abused, 
His Gospel rejected, His mercy refused.

The men of mischief spread!

And malice, with her watchful eye, 
Pursues them to destroy.

Into Thy pastures leap; 
The lion and the stupid ass 
Conspire to vex Thy sheep.

To root them from the ground, 
Till not the name of saints remain, 
Nor memory shall be found.

Of angels in the height.

Fear not, doubt not; His steadfast Word 
Unchanging shall endure.

Pardon there was multiplied to me;

Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary.

At even, ere the sun was set, 
The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay; 
O, with how many pains they met! 
O, with what joy they went away!

Once more tis eventide, and we,
Oppressed with various ills, draw near; 
What if Thyself we cannot see? 
We know that Thou art ever near.

O Savior Christ, our woes dispel; 
For some are sick, and some are sad; 
And some have never loved Thee well, 
And some have lost the love they had.

And some are pressed with worldly care 
And some are tried with sinful doubt; 
And some such grievous passions tear, 
That only Thou canst cast them out.
At Even, Ere The Sun Was Set
 
And some have found the world is vain, 
Yet from the world they break not free; 
And some have friends who give them pain, 
Yet have not sought a friend in Thee.
At Even, Ere The Sun Was Set
 
And none, O Lord, have perfect rest, 
For none are wholly free from sin; 
And they who fain would serve Thee best 
Are conscious most of wrong within.
At Even, Ere The Sun Was Set
 
O Savior Christ, Thou too art man; 
Thou has been troubled, tempted, tried; 
Thy kind but searching glance can scan 
The very wounds that shame would hide.
At Even, Ere The Sun Was Set
 
Thy touch has still its ancient power. 
No word from Thee can fruitless fall; 
Hear, in this solemn evening hour, 
And in Thy mercy heal us all.

Deep love to God and man;

Bowed with anguish, deeply grievèd, 
Felt the sharp and piercing sword.

Pierced by anguish so amazing 
Born of woman, would not weep?

Such a cup of sorrow drinking 
Would not share her sorrows deep?

For His people's sins chastisèd,
She beheld her Son despisèd, 
Scourged, and crowned with thorns entwined; 
Saw Him then from judgment taken, 
And in death by all forsaken, 
Till His Spirit He resigned.

"Awake, My Heart; Arise, My Tongue
 
Awake, my heart; arise, my tongue, 
Prepare a tuneful voice; 
In God, the life of all my joys, 
Aloud will I rejoice.
Awake, My Heart; Arise, My Tongue
 
'Tis He adorned my naked soul,
And made salvation mine; 
Upon a poor polluted worm 
He makes His graces shine.

And lest the shadow of a spot 
Should on my soul be found, 
He took the robe the Savior wrought, 
And cast it all around.

How far the heav'nly robe exceeds
What earthly princes wear! 
These ornaments, how bright they shine! 
How white the garments are!

The Spirit wrought my faith, and love, 
And hope, and every grace; 
But Jesus spent His life to work 
The robe of righteousness.

By the great Sacred Three!

"Awake, My Heart, With Gladness
 
Awake, my heart, with gladness, 
See what today is done; 
Now, after gloom and sadness, 
Comes forth the glorious Sun. 
My Savior there was laid 
Where our bed must be made 
When to the realms of light 
Our spirit wings its flight.
Awake, My Heart, With Gladness
 
The foe in triumph shouted 
When Christ lay in the tomb; 
But, lo, he now is routed, 
His boast is turned to gloom. 
For Christ again is free; 
In glorious victory 
He Who is strong to save 
Has triumphed o'er the grave.
Awake, My Heart, With Gladness
 
This is a sight that gladdens; 
What peace it doth impart! 
Now nothing ever saddens 
The joy within my heart. 
No gloom shall ever shake, 
No foe shall ever take, 
The hope which God's own Son
In love for me hath won.
Awake, My Heart, With Gladness
 
Now hell, its prince, the devil 
Of all their powers are shorn; 
Now I am safe from evil, 
And sin I laugh to scorn. 
Grim Death with all his might 
Cannot my soul affright; 
He is a powerless form, 
Howe'er he rave and storm.
Awake, My Heart, With Gladness
 
The world against me rageth 
Its fury I disdain; 
Though bitter war it wageth 
Its work is all in vain. 
My heart from care is free, 
No trouble troubles me. 
Misfortune now is play 
And night is bright as day.
Awake, My Heart, With Gladness
 
Now I will cling forever 
To Christ, my Savior true; 
My Lord will leave me never, 
Whate'er He passeth through.
He rends Death's iron chain,
He breaks through sin and pain, 
He shatters hell's dark thrall,
I follow Him through all.
Awake, My Heart, With Gladness
 
To halls of heavenly splendor 
With Him I penetrate; 
And trouble ne'er may hinder
Nor make me hesitate. 
Let tempests rage at will, 
My Savior shields me still; 
He grants abiding peace 
And bids all tumult cease.
Awake, My Heart, With Gladness
 
He brings me to the portal 
That leads to bliss untold, 
Whereon this rhyme immortal 
Is found in script of gold: 
Who there My cross hath shared 
Finds here a crown prepared; 
Who there with Me hath died 
Shall here be glorified.

"Baptized Into Thy Name Most Holy
 
Baptized into Thy Name most holy, 
O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, 
I claim a place, though weak and lowly, 
Among Thy seed, Thy chosen host. 
Buried with Christ and dead to sin, 
Thy Spirit now shall live within.
Baptized Into Thy Name Most Holy
 
My loving Father, Thou dost take me 
To be henceforth Thy child and heir; 
My faithful Savior, Thou dost make me 
The fruit of all Thy sorrows share; 
Thou, Holy Ghost, wilt comfort me 
When darkest clouds around I see.
Baptized Into Thy Name Most Holy
 
And I have vowed to fear and love Thee 
And to obey Thee, Lord, alone; 
Because the Holy Ghost did move me, 
I dared to pledge myself Thine own, 
Renouncing sin to keep the faith 
And war with evil unto death.
Baptized Into Thy Name Most Holy
 
My faithful God, Thou failest never, 
Thy cov'nant surely will abide;
Oh, cast me not away forever 
Should I transgress it on my side! 
Tho' I have oft my soul defiled,
Do Thou forgive, restore, Thy child.
Baptized Into Thy Name Most Holy
 
Yea, all I am and love most dearly 
I offer now, O Lord, to Thee. 
Oh, let me make my vows sincerely 
And help me Thine own child to be! 
Let naught within me, naught I own, 
Serve any will but Thine alone.
Baptized Into Thy Name Most Holy
 
And never let my purpose falter, 
O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, 
But keep me faithful to Thine altar 
Till Thou shalt call me from my post. 
So unto Thee I live or die 
And praise Thee evermore on high.

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; 
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; 
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword; 
His truth is marching on. 
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps 
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;

As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal;

Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; 
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, 
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me:

He is wisdom to the mighty, He is honor to the brave; 
So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong His slave,

"Be Now Imitators Of Your Lord
 
Be now imitators of your Lord; 
You're His children through His love outpoured.
Let love show now in all you do, 
As Christ loved and gave Himself for you, 
As a sacrifice to God.
Be Now Imitators Of Your Lord
 
All impurity put far away. 
Don't be greedy; watch the things you say.
These aren't proper for God's dear children;
You will never gain the wealth of Heaven, 
In the kingdom of Christ and God.
Be Now Imitators Of Your Lord
 
Don't be taken in by empty words;
Those who disobey, God's wrath incur.
You were darkness, but now you're light;
Let your life be good and true and right, 
And find out what pleases God.
Be Now Imitators Of Your Lord
 
Stay away from fruitless deeds, 
Done in secret out of lust and greed. 
Let Christ's light shine on all that's dark,
And expose what's missed God's mark.
Bring to light every sinful act.
Be Now Imitators Of Your Lord
 
So be careful in the things you do; 
Act with wisdom in whate'er you pursue.
Make the most of every hour; 
Don't let evil exercise its power.
Be not foolish, but know God's will.
Be Now Imitators Of Your Lord
 
Let the Spirit now your life control, 
And let psalms and hymns flow from your soul. 
In your heart, speak to God and sing, 
Giving thanks for everything, 
In the name of Jesus Christ.

O Thou of God and man the Son, 
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor, 
Thou, my soul's glory, joy and crown.

Robed in the blooming garb of spring; 
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer, 
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

Fairer still the moonlight, 
And all the twinkling starry host;

Than all the angels heaven can boast.

Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee;

With a note saying I love you

But if you kissed me now 
I know you'd fool me again

"Praise The Lord Who Reigns Above
 
Praise the Lord Who reigns above and keeps His court below; 
Praise the holy God of love and all His greatness show; 
Praise Him for His noble deeds; praise Him for His matchless power; 
Him from Whom all good proceeds let earth and heaven adore.
Praise The Lord Who Reigns Above
 
Publish, spread to all around the great Jehovah's name,
Let the trumpet's martial sound the Lord of hosts proclaim:
Praise Him in the sacred dance, harmony's full concert raise,
Let the virgin choir advance, and move but to His praise.
Praise The Lord Who Reigns Above
 
Celebrate th'eternal God with harp and psaltery,
Timbrels soft and cymbals loud in this high praise agree; 
Praise with every tuneful string; all the reach of heavenly art, 
All the powers of music bring, the music of the heart.
Praise The Lord Who Reigns Above
 
God, in Whom they move and live, let every creature sing, 
Glory to their Maker give, and homage to their King. 
Hallowed be Thy Name beneath, as in heaven on earth adored; 
Praise the Lord in every breath, let all things praise the Lord.

Languishing in Satan's prison lie the souls of God's elect.
At the Cross-desire of Hell!-Christ gives up that final Breath: 
Now, at last, the choicest Captive tastes the mortal sting of Death!

Darkness falls; the seething smoke of Hell cloaks the battlefield from view. 
Down the head of God has fallen: Law and Wrath receive their due! 
Satan smiles in seeming triumph, reaching out, his Prize to take. 
Three brief days all Hell rejoices-then the stone begins to shake!

Now the night of wrong is ended; now the Grave has lost its Prize! 
Now the Ris'n One breaks the back of Sin: There! Behold! See how Death dies!
Resurrection Light now scatters Satan's armies from the field.
Christ has drawn the fearful sting of Death: Sheol and Abaddon yield!

At His Glance the mighty prison built by Law and Sin falls down! 
Countless in their thousand thousands, all His Ransomed praise His Crown!

And our faith has gone up, like a bird on the wing, 
To that land on eternity's shore,
Where the joy bells of Eden forever shall ring, 
And the soul shall be weary no more.
The Beautiful Land
 
We are nearing that land, we are nearing the gate, 
To the city of jasper and gold, 
Where the Savior to welcome His children doth wait, 
And will gather them into the fold; 
To the fold of His love, in the mansions above, 
Where forever with Him they shall dwell, 
And the eyes that were sad in His smile shall be glad, 
And the lips never murmur, Farewell.

"THE FIRST CHRISTMAS SONG
 
Beautiful song of Christmas! 
Sung in the long ago,

Down to the earth below.

Burst forth in music sweet, 
While from afar the wise men 
Gathered at Jesus' feet.

Bring your gifts to the Savior's feet.
Let each heart with His praises ring 
Pay your homage to Jesus, our Prince and King!

Beautiful song of Christmas, 
Message of peace, good will, 
Sung first by angel chorus, 
Sweetly it echoes still.

Hope long deferred grew dim, 
Till from the glowing heavens, 
Angels now told of Him.

Join in the theme of ages, 
With the glad angel throng.

"The Handwriting On The Wall
 
At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand of his lords, 
While they drank from golden vessels, as the Book of Truth records, 
In the night, as they reveled in the royal palace hall, 
They were seized with consternation-'twas the Hand upon the wall!
The Handwriting On The Wall
 
Refrain
The Handwriting On The Wall
 
'Tis the hand of God on the wall!
Tis the hand of God on the wall!
Shall the record be Found wanting! 
Or shall it be Found trusting! 
While that hand is writing on the wall?
The Handwriting On The Wall
 
See the brave captive, Daniel, as he stood before the throng, 
And rebuked the haughty monarch for his mighty deeds of wrong; 
As he read out the writing-'twas the doom of one and all,
For the kingdom now was finished-said the Hand upon the wall!
The Handwriting On The Wall
 
Refrain
The Handwriting On The Wall
 
See the faith, zeal and courage, that would dare to do the right, 
Which the Spirit gave to Daniel-'twas the secret of his might,
In his home in Judea, or a captive in the hall, 
He understood the writing of his God upon the wall!
The Handwriting On The Wall
 
Refrain
The Handwriting On The Wall
 
So our deeds are recorded-there's a Hand that's writing now:
Sinner, give your heart to Jesus, to His royal mandates bow; 
For the day is approaching-it must come to one and all, 
When the sinners' condemnation will be written on the wall!

"The Hour-glass
 
Alas! how swift the moments fly! 
How flash the years along! 
Scarce here, yet gone already by, 
The burden of a song. 
See childhood, youth, and manhood pass, 
And age, with furrowed brow; 
Time was-Time shall be-drain the glass- 
But where in Time is now?
The Hour-glass
 
Time is the measure but of change; 
No present hour is found; 
The past, the future, fill the range 
Of Time's unceasing round.
Where, then is now? In realms above, 
With God's atoning Lamb,
In regions of eternal love, 
Where sits enthroned I AM.
The Hour-glass
 
Then pilgrim, let thy joys and tears 
On Time no longer lean; 
But henceforth all thy hopes and fears 
From earth's affections wean:
To God let votive accents rise; 
With truth, with virtue, live; 
So all the bliss that Time denies 
Eternity shall give.

"Thy Brother Calls To Thee
 
Awake, O Christian, from thy sleep, 
And heed thy brother's call!
He cries to thee across the deep, 
Where darkest shadows falls. 
From sin and guilt and wretchedness 
He knows not where to flee; 
Go tell him how the Lord can bless! 
Thy brother calls to thee.
Thy Brother Calls To Thee
 
'Mid deepest gloom and darkest night
He lifts his helpless hands; 
Can aught but Jesus give him light 
Or break his cruel bands? 
Then send, O send the Master's Word
Across the wide blue sea, 
Where Macedonia's cry is heard!
Thy brother calls to thee.
Thy Brother Calls To Thee
 
O save the lost, the sinner turn! 
To blind men send the light! 
O let thy soul with ardor burn 
To lead them to the right; 
Then usher in that glorious day, 
The kingdom yet to be, 
When all shall own the Master's sway!
Thy brother calls to thee.

"Vain are all terrestrial pleasures
 
Vain are all terrestrial pleasures, 
Mixed with dross the purest gold: 
Seek we, then, for heavenly treasures, 
Treasures never waxing old. 
Let our best affections center 
On the things around the throne: 
There no thief can ever enter; 
Moth and rust are there unknown.
Vain are all terrestrial pleasures
 
Earthly joys no longer please us; 
Here would we renounce them all; 
Seek our only rest in Jesus, 
Him our Lord and Master call. 
Faith, our languid spirits cheering, 
Points to brighter worlds above; 
Bids us look for His appearing; 
Bids us triumph in His love.
Vain are all terrestrial pleasures
 
May our light be always burning, 
And our loins be girded round, 
Waiting for our Lord's returning,
Longing for the welcome sound. 
Thus the Christian life adorning, 
Never need we be afraid, 
Should He come at night or morning 
Early dawn, or evening shade.

"Watchman, tell me, does the morning
 
Watchman, tell me, does the morning 
Of fair Zion's glory dawn;
Have the signs that mark His coming 
Yet upon my pathway shone? 
Pilgrim, yes, arise, look round thee, 
Light is breaking in the skies; 
Spurn the unbelief that bound thee, 
Morning dawns, arise, arise!
Watchman, tell me, does the morning
 
See the glorious light ascending 
Of the grand Sabbatic year, 
Hark! the voices loud proclaiming 
The Messiah's kingdom near;
Watchman, yes; I see just yonder, 
Canaan's glorious heights arise;
Salem, too, appears in grandeur, 
Tow'ring neath her sunlit skies.
Watchman, tell me, does the morning
 
Pilgrim, in that golden city, 
Seated in the jasper throne, 
Zion's King, arrayed in beauty,
Reigns in peace from zone to zone; 
There, on verdant hills and mountains, 
Where the golden sunbeams play, 
Purling streams, and crystal fountains, 
Sparkle in th'eternal day.
Watchman, tell me, does the morning
 
Pilgrim, see, the light is beaming 
Brighter still upon thy way; 
Signs through all the earth are gleaming, 
Omens of thy coming day, 
When the last loud trumpet sounding, 
Shall awake from earth and sea, 
All the saints of God now sleeping, 
Clad in immortality!
Watchman, tell me, does the morning
 
Watchman, lo, the land we're nearing
With its vernal fruits and flowers! 
On just yonder, O how cheering! 
Bloom forever Eden flowers. 
Hark, the choral strains are ringing, 
Wafted on the balmy air! 
See the millions! hear their singing! 
Soon the pilgrims will be there.
