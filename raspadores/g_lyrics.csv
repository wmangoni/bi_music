Bobby said, Fuck spendin 50 on a whip, buy equip 
Mental flip, got a thousand tracks stored on a chip 
Said he had mad toys to make noise 
You split and separate drums like asteroids 
The concerned producer sampled this question 
Hit him with the beat for the answer, with extra compression 
When sound travel, it quickly grab you 
and equalizes the pitch up, until it have you 
Bugged out, tryin to think you can match this 
The portrait's too graphic
Panaramic view for you, stamp Wu  
The feature gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic 
We wrote block-tic checkpoints on your next joint 
and who the nigga you annoint? 
700 volts on the track to slay 
Murderous wordplay displayed, for killin cascades 
Throwin bullets in the air to test wind 
and which way the cyclone spins 
Counter on clockwise, still civilized 
Kill spies on the wall, that still flies all dies

Give no extension on the lynchin 
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt, that causes one to flash his gun
and reveal how he really feel, confirmed 
He'll never live after the show, see the promoted for the dough
I'm takin, breakin his wax
Throw my shit on to perform my selection from the Swarm 
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in revines and ditches 
Underneath shrubs and leaves 
They breathed thru underwater reeds 
The enemy walks above, Clan remain subterranean mud 
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location 
Bombarded by the circle of death formation 
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes 
Shatterin bulletproof helmets with scrap nail fragments 
of cell, inhale these venomous thoughs that I propel 
thru the north facility, the city must suffer at the hand 
of the Chief's command, volts is in
At 3 minute intervals the heat intenses 
deadenin the power from electrical fences 
Defences are down, shake a nigga up, bounce him off the sound

[Interlude: Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man
 
You know what I'm sayin?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris. 
We talk about sex, money and drugs. 
(Ruled by power.) And y'all cats don't know
what it's about. (Love and power.)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV.

Burnin desire, ebony eyes 
Painted toe nails, legacys die 
Drivin by the well, egyption queens, arabian shieks 
are paid to knock off rich kings, for the joy some sing 
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows, who stabbed they 
husbands 
Sleepin on silk pillows, blood on they robes 
Disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes 
Lambs and wolfs in black hoods, pull out they gats 
like magic wands, castin spells, sendin niggaz to Hell 
Trappin they souls in realms, baptize em with holy water 
Springin on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters 
Silent nights over the dividers, a 1000 muslim bibles 
for the cobler, hebrews flee to the hills of Masada 
for the love of God, guns make a loud sound 
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shoot outs, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down 
Cursed nation, lost generation 
X-Files, describe them in the future as cosmic rulers 
Fallen angels from space intruders 
Dyin saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint 
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures 
Dissolve it with your 100 proof liqour

Ha, I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly 
Threatenin the lives of those who threaten me 
Lessenin my chances of defeat by predeterminin the victory 
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one 
I heard my words shall be bombed, regardless to anything or 
anyone 
I die by the gun, my life has just begun 
Thought I was livin all along, but I was wrong 
This long road I have to travel in countless battles 
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles 
Kings, queens and pharoahs change to cattle 
I'm able to subtract the devil's arrow
Singin at his eyes on the sparrow, mind narrow 
2 positions, horoscopes and tarots 
Hark harolds, angels and Christmas carols 
Raven images hang from the mantels 
Man made slaves and modern day babbles 
Raw from Africa and golden ropes and sandles 
by wicked thieves and vandals 
who man-handled us with leather whips and burnin candles 
and rambled thru our castle, leavin niggaz shambles 
Stole our golden sodas like some arab camels 
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo 
with to the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow 
We went to Gretal and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackel 
Children of my grand old daddy, have me 
In mind were they lost in this wilderness blind?

I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm

Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds 
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit 
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip

A hit was sent, from the President, to rage your residence 
Because you had secret evidence, and documents 
on how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent

The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu 
Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus 
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris 
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin lakes 
of hot oil, it boils your skin, chickenheads gettin slim 
like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil 
Fortified with essential, vitamin and minerals

The queen by far, is the strongest piece 
Should too, should not be prematurely brought 
Into play, during in the opening 
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces 
And driven back, it is very dangerous 
To make a raid with the queen early on in the game 
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen 
And that, to a square where she is not exposed 
To any direct or indirect attack

That was just another spot on the muthafuckin' block
You forgot Cash Rule nigga? --- toss seven figures 
He pull a trigger to make that account, get bigger 
Had babies to feed, kept a bitch with need 
Thousands shows booked, promoters on speed 
His hands was in everything, including some pussy 
From the Brazilian wax, to the uncombed bushy 
From down state, psychiatric 
Who tried to put a code on his brain until he cracked it 
Now the media wanna view him like they knew him 
And his head nurse, wanna sue him cause she blew him 
Ever since he walked on stage, he was just a loose cannon 
Wild drunk staggin  a nigga who kept standing

And had bitches eating out of his hand 
He was intelligent, his style was relevant 
I can name ten niggaz that stole an element 
From the high speed chase to the court arraignments 
All of the above, was entertainment 
He caused earthquakes, just from experiments 
Some thoughts got lost, not knowing where it went 
His songs had a rep for many inducements 
Giving birth to new styles, after recruitments 
There's no replacement or any supplement
He was a new testament, what he said, what he meant, we were

Gave him no phone calls, saw no sunlight 
Like, Billie the Kid, in his last gun fight 
Then days became weeks, weeks became months 
Carved the calendar on the wall, with his front 
The food pushed in, on the trays, looking sharp, in the cell 
My hands covered with latex gloves 
Cooks in the kitchen had laced his drinks 
The wild ass physician, they was off the breaks 
He got visits from shrinks who came in with ink-blots 
Moving with they own plot, but the Dirt, he think not 
He had nothing but time on his hands 
As if he got him signed from the Clan, we were

That vacate your vessel 
Guide this, strenuous as an arm wrestle 
Move swift as light, a thousand years in one night 
Then flight with insight 
Everything i thought of, I saw it happen 
Then I rose from the soil to sun blacken 
Then came rao czars, left tracks and scarred 
A pair of brightness of exploding stars 
Gave me goods to taste 
No ingredients to traced 
And remained stuffed trying to figure the shape of space 
No edge or boundary, released 2 rounds or 3 
Intimidate my razor scrape, phony clown MC 
The physical shatter from the blast 
Pierclastic flow sets of a tower of ash 
Through ignorance and misplaced trust your world's crushed
Too late to activate hyperspace of thrust 
Even wearing camoflauge the analog at war 
He seen his high beems 
The father came in accompianed by deadly rain and when 
Mentally indowed when lighting hit the crowd 
The warm side crushed the barrier 
The storm side destroyed your area

Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch  
The rat squeals  
And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals  
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles  
Where the leopards grab the wilderbeast down by it's tail 
You see the chimps they grow hips they hustle and sling in trees

Elephants for security that move tons of leaves  
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk  
or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the 
hawk  
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain  
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane 
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra  
He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah  
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat 
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet  
Now you're neck deep in depth with a bunch of lone sharks 
So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see  
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators  
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later  
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees  
the tick moved with the fleas  
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas  
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow  
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough  
See a million mosquitos from the West now

Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark  
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved 
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved  
And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist  
And the bats use their sonar to guide and assist  
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale  
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail

I pulled up on the block, go out the truck, tt was the first of pit stops 
The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop
That was somethin  I had identified with
So I, made it my point to exploit this fly gift then 
Myself and RZA, made trips to the B.X. 
A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex
Giants in every ways, rap flows for every day 
We knew we would get a reward for the price we'll pay
The basic training was beyond entertainment 
Just the caters of the verbal expressions, self explainin
Were my boots out in constant walks across the borough 
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough 
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most 
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast 
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop 
Cause M.C.'s be more shook then the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin  then the point is definitely proven
Cause with the GZA holdin  that keep a nigga movin

The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man 
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats 
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead

While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slaked them in a scrimmage 
He continued tarnish that, already faded image 
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom 
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke 
Like too many tokes, that'll recharge in growth

With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder 
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage

Where unskilled skaters, couldn't figure-8 twice
At 16, uncut, direct from the cult 
Head on assault, the result, death by the bolt 
In a vote, it spoke aboat the average loss commission 
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision 
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast 
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash 
It kept the jury quiet, and now a riot will form 
While satanic man, now hang in his dorm 
I swing, on you fake, radio personalities 
Boost ya ratings, but hypes behind casualties 
Fire shots, for low-pressure water gun play 
Instantly, slap ya fire like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements 
The earth use, and built it to a complex 
Network, of communications, you're up against a hopeless, situation
I screen every vehicle, through enemy observation 
Swarmin unpredictably, we spread terror 
Increase the force significantly, change the error

Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis 
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with 
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with 
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas workin for the Feds 
Sent out secretly to take my head 
I lay back and meditate to the words they say 
Skip town for a mutten goofy dred 
Had a friend tell my family I was dead 
Return at the last fall of the autumn leaves 
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the Feds are recordin me 
Sign all documents, usin forgery, cuz just a near thought of me 
Like Solomon, spoke bluntly 
Told the word I'm black and calmly
Howls from the grave haunt me 
The smell of death's upon me, I dwell in the hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants, and old kings 
Who sold everything, on a quest for god's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind 
Who prayed 3 times, when the moon lit and the sun rise 
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds 
Been in the mouth of many leopards 
Felt the death kiss, of Satan's mistress
Walked the vacant districts, for 4 religions, studied Pagan scriptures 
True philosophers and physicians, on a cure missions 
Who harden their hearts, to ward the weak, sick and ifflicted 
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch 
Who made me love her, when I touch her, soft cause hide claws 
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth 
Have bitter stingers at they tail 
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hold on to hell 
Embracing her was like embracing a 3rd world

The first shall be last and the last shall be first 
The basic instructions before leaving earth
B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)
 
Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve 
I loved doing right but I was trapped in hell 
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears 
Years of fears, but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth 
And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying, plus the praying 
I didn't like staying cuz of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies 
Had me cooped up lookin at loot, butt, and thighs 
Durin the service, he swallowed up the poor 
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor 
But I ignored, and explored my history that was untold 
And watched mysteries unfold 
And dropped a jewel like Solomon, but never followed men 
Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than 
Space oblivia, or the abyss 
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss 
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind? 
From a slave we was kept from the mind 
And from the caves he crept from behind 
And what he gave, was the sect of the swine 
When the bible, it condemned the pig 
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your qigs
But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie 
No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts 
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax 
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time 
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme 
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind 
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet 
Those who sit home, or sell books by the market 
Need to chill and get their mind revived 
For years religion did nothing but divide 
The basic instructions before leaving earth
B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)
 
I strolled through the books of Job to unfold 
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals 
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah 
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverand
Why should you die to go to heaven? 
The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace 
A difficult task I had to take 
I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when 
I found out that we were the chosen 
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth 
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop 
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men 
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs 
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion 
I quiz Son with my wisdom 
Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted 
The study of wisdom, I perferred it 
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom 
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam 
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia 
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander 
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown 
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn 
For my nation - the seed of Abraham 
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew 
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness 
Peace to my nephew Marcus

Talking Superman shit, when you ain't got ya S on?

Leave nothing left for you, but residue, the state of vegetable

But we punish those who play dumb, years bluffing 
Floods and bloodbaths, up on elevator shafts

Spark wires from auto-fire, verbal and slang with gats 
Screws filled with casualties, wherever the tanks was at

Yo, in these dark streets, life is never complete 
Lords escape from those who strictly Play IV Keeps 
Neighborhood; poverty stricten 
Spin and Tell like Charles Dickens 
The witnesses are sickening 
I seen some aquitted with the wildest crime commited 
While my brother faced life and never did it 
Even in High Tide, they throwing brothers off the boat 
In the streets, without a vest, it's hard to stay a-float
She wrote a note, before she *sliced her throat* 
Couldn't live without her son, who was killed for his coat
I closely examined, physical branden 
Witnessed myself standing in a land struck with famine 
Multiple homocides from atomic wars 
The aftermath, poison in lakes and reseviors 
Thoughts spin, I narrowly escaped Hell's Gate
But only in the physical state

Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in...

Babies crying brothers dying and brothers getting not 
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down 
in this cold, cold world...
Cold World
 
[GZA
 
It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fuckin projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec 
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
and blasted on the spot before the pigs were dere 
You know hoods robbers snipers new in sight fuck blue and white 
They escape before them flash the fuckin lights 
Gunshots, shatter first floor window panes 
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game 
Whether broke callisthetic, any style you set it 
Beat niggaz toothless, physically cut up like gooses 
But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses 
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless 
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats 
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats 
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold 
and squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill 
Destruction worker, who was caught for his bomber 
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggaz catch slugs
and pockets dug from everything except check stubs 
and it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville 
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look 
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggaz layin on roof tops 
for his CREAM he stashed in a shoebox 
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers 
you don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets 
those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate 
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then 
Drop those who crack like calicos from Mexican 
Rappin like recipients cashin checks again 
Back to the motherfuckin spot on Lexington

Babies crying brothers dying and brothers getting not 
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down

Stick up kids on the ground broke the staircase light 
And I stays harassed, scramblin for petty cash 
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learnin fast

Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars 
Hospital floors surrounded by the law 
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door 
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team 
Cause niggaz main concern is CREAM 
Some niggaz in the jet black Gallant 
Shot up the Chinese resteraunt, for this kid named Lamont 
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid 
and hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled 
Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast 
Cause the crime boss is passin off cash 
Extortions, for portions of streets, causes beef

Then I see this lady with a hellafied body 
With a pair of bedroom eyes that were clocking The Genius

To me so what I did, I reacted 
In a manner to show that I was feeling the same

And that I had her running on a wild sex craze 
I said now you're kinda big and well-developed
And parts of your body just made my head swell up 
She said her feelings were so deep for me 
To the point where she wanted to sleep with me 
I said c'mon babe, I know you're jokin
She said if I'm jokin' you must be smokin
I said the only think I wanna be smokin' is your boots
And she said I hear ya troop 
And just from that little bit of conversation 
It put my hormones into activation 
The whole thing just went to my head 
As I held her hands and said 
Baby, come do me

Hey good looking how many times may I say 
That your gorgeous smile takes my breath away 
Your soft warm little voice is very pleasing 
And your tight mini-skirt is kind teasing 
Me, it makes me wanna do the nasty 
And you got the look of being very classy 
So go ahead and whip it on me 
As Latifah said,gimme that body 
So you see right there I desire you

[GZA
 
I come from a place where they say, death comes too soon 
Where the hoods on the block, dance to a different tune 
Every night and every day, hotels of foul play 
Turns fatal, when this hostile land of AK's
On any date, not wait to pump them rounds 
The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness, gunned down in the staircase 
Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace
Many suspects, many possible motives 
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives 
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions 
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position 
The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force 
And lives, they get lost, on a collision course 
The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more 
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors 
Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted 
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it 
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents 
Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence
A man died holding some dice that he was shaking 
Like a bank stop, but no valuables was taken 
Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9 
A video was the most precise witness to the crime
Destruction Of a Guard
 
[Chorus 2X

Destruction Of a Guard
 
[GZA
 
The story had a familiar ring of truth 
But it needed, a little more tangible proof 
He was blown off the map, behind the aggravated kidnaps 
Shrap' metal everywhere, the bomb was gift wrapped
The problem had became increasingly urgent 
Since the product was nothing but bags of detergent 
In all the years of war, this was the most 
Vicious battle and mainly fought from up close 
A bundle burglary, with no surprise 
Just another sloppy murder that was in disguise 
Now they can do nothing but hope and pray 
That the boys don't come through with the scope and spray
Valuable time comes with a price to pay 
Smoke on a deserted street, just a mile away 
Tusslin' with those cannibals, right from the start
That'll rip out your heart, and consume the fattest part
Better watch from the eye of federal agents 
Selecting cams, while they was disguised as vagrants 
Not knowing that a prisoner had held the key 
Of a co-defendant, he was so far from free 
Detectives search into a distant past 
Of a young gun who made the block grow fast 
Narrow ducks who were cooked and came home to roast 
The suspects would seek refuge off the coast
Destruction Of a Guard

The herds start stomping the promoters that be fronting 
They sue for Cash Rule but the courts they give em nothing

Your soundman came with the feedback like we need that 
Security\'s shining flashlights like where the weed at? 
Stay in your place, see you guys smoke blowing in your face 
And it's hard to stop it once we came to drop it
Who bold enough to challenge this deadly reportation 
Of keeping MC's in a hopeless situation
No comparison, if you put the darts side by side 
One will weigh out the other 
Like friend next to brother 
Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion 
That structure that supported your rap started implosion 
Your whole chest and your world caved in 
They completely gave in, they just sparks and brave men

So you know it be authentic like the hand-made works of a carpenter 
The 64 squares make em use a sharpener
Kept a fine point with the lead, then it's thread
On the paper then like cancer it would rapidly spread 
This music is addictive but can't live without it
At times you shout it The Wu, they be about it

Not to play it is a terrible loss at whose cost? 
People wait like never before for the ball to drop 
At the gate lined up for a tape to cop 
I still run into students banging my first joint 
Wrote a essay off the second LP to prove a point 
That a rhyme is a terrible thing to waste 
Gimmicks and radio the God don't chase
But I replace your wackness, it shows in your flows

Talkin bout drama
DRAMA
 
I met a young brother, how young about eight 
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight 
I greeted him, and struck a conversation 
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation 
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency 
I said gettin paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment 
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent 
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats 
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeeahhhh boyyyeee, that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me 
Cuz we are the victims, of a situation 
How wicked man, seperated 
a nation and got us cold-killin off one another 
(Word-word, to the mother) 
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
Cuz the murder and crime rate is rising very high 
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map? 
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary 
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area 
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
*blam blam* and scarier and scarier 
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin bout drama
DRAMA
 
Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless 
Cuz I can see that they suffer from a long list 
From not having shelter, and out on the street 
without a job and days without a bite to eat 
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
about some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way 
And it took em on a trip for a long day 
Got to the point you started stealing from your house 
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse 
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's, five, below and we're ex-pecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand 
Then after you run that game for a while 
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile 
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit 
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues? 
About you can't get a job well go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real 
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin bout drama 
Not wonderama 
But I'm talkin bout drama
Here what I'm sayin?
I'm not talkin bout your mama
Nahhhh, but I'm talkin bout drama

"Duel Of The Iron Mic

Ohh mad one 
We see your trap 
You can never escape, your fate 
Submit with honor to a duel, with my son 
I agree
Duel Of The Iron Mic
 
[Kung Fu sample
 
I see you using an old style, I wondered where you had learned it from 
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, by the Gods, will you show me? 
And where do you come for? 
You come here, since you're so interested
Fight me
Duel Of The Iron Mic
 
[Intro: Inspectah Deck
 
Yo God, it's a duel, it's a duel

Duel of the Iron Mic 
Duel of the Iron Mic 
In the moonlight niggaz I will strike 
What, what? Bring it!
Duel Of The Iron Mic
 
[GZA
 
Yo, picture bloodbaths in elevator shafts 
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft 
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow movin MC's is waitin for the editin
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry 
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry 
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers 
Smokin Exodus, every square yard is plush 
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions, facial expression 
leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessin 
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss 
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings 
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings 
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
on July 4th from Bed-Stuy 
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thievin MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves, they can't breathe
Blood splash, rushin fast like runnin rivers 
I be that whiskey in your liver

when the Gods get on to perform storms blew up 
Wu's up, causin the crowd to self-destruct
Killa Beez are stingin somethin while I reveal 
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombin your barracks, with aerodynamic 
swordplay, poison darts by the doorway 
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damagin lyrical launcher 
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure 
any contender, testin the murderous Masta 
could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts 
explode through your barrier, rips the retina 
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing 
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock 
Seekin for a serum, to cure em
Duel Of The Iron Mic
 
[Inspectah Deck
 
Thugs kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust 
Duckin handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush 
Out of town foes look shook but still pose 
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll 
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh 
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Bulding lobbies are graveyards for small-timers 
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas 
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt 
You get bagged up, dependin if you're passin the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's livin heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest 
individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded 
Blinded by illusion, findin it confusin

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another 
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy

The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost

"Exploitation Of Mistakes
 
[GZA
 
Two individuals, pulled from a lake 
Inside a vehicle, one had his foot on the break 
The windows was fully up and the doors was locked 
The news made the headline, and the town was shocked 
The driver was clutching a can of Hi-C 
His jacket was tied, to a near by tree 
His jeans had dye in them, and a usual tattoo 
Was the only hope, to identifying them 
The autopsies revealed gun shot wounds 
Dental records matched to a newlywed groom 
This accident, was a cover up for homicide 
Two who might of, stayed alive from paying bribes 
Sheets investigators, had relied on the media 
For help, and to track down the perpetrated 
They canvassed the neighborhood, with standard procedure 
And visited the home, of a topless skeezer 
Who was at the bar, when he was last seen alive 
Left with him, just ten minutes after they arrived 
Despite the police efforts, they turned up nothing 
Just an ex-hooker, try'nna get a rep from bluffing
But the wide publicity, had just paid off 
From a hard rock inmate, who was just made soft 
He said he knew a man who killed the pop star 
And almost got caught by a passing cop car 
The inmate said probably, the motive was robbery 
And knowing if he keeping it a secret, it bothers me 
He said this individual killed for low billings 
And purchased a murder kit, blocks from the killing 
The sheriff's office, had no time to waste
Plus the inmate never deal, to avoid the case 
So he co-operated fully, and snitched on his 
Chop shop mechanic, who used to move bodies on the pulley 
An extortionist, involved in similar incidents 
Payments that came in thousand dollar increments 
Suspicious activities that flooded the place 
So they subpoenaed phone records for the calls was traced 
The hair that was taken from his car interior 
Was that of a young girl, who felt inferior 
She died fighting and probably aroused his anger 
Holding off her life, as she faced the strangler 
The crime seemed to be sexual from nature 
It was substantial evidence, that the nigga raped her 
The suspects had marks on his face and chest 
But it just wasn't enough, to get an arrest
Asked of his whereabouts, on the third of July 
Said he partied with his friends, and had a solid alibi 
But it was really something left at the scene, on a small scale 
Was the microscopic traces of blood, under her fingernails

Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit 
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs 
Drunk a cup of blood 
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug 
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up 
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture 
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas

Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred

From being approached by The Genius of rap

You see, I be coming with strong rhymes galore 
That even a stubborn MC can't ignore
That trying to defeat me brings about danger 
Like a child speaking to a stranger 
Soft MC's, I see more and more
With an ancient style, the prehistoric bore 
Yes, they scream and roar until their throat get sore 
Now they're running to the neighborhood drug store
To buy the cough drop for what? The wrong hip hop 
Now they swear they're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop

About to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor 
Under the subway, waiting for the train to make noise 
So I can blast a nigga and his boys - for what? 
He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop 
Like the crashin of Dow Jones stock 
I had to connect to cross seals, to catch more mil's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills 
I'm in the park, settin up a deal over blunt fire
Bum niggaz sleepin on the bench, they had em wired 
Peeped my convo, the address of my condo 
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe 
And while we set up camp, we got Vamp 
Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart 
Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee 
Blown out the frame, like Pan Am flight 103

Filthy foul, shoveling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth 
His idols would lock down airports and extort 
some import, catchin ten percent of what the fiends snort 
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills 
They move keys and had skis making drops on snowmobiles 
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers

"High Price, Small Reward
 
[GZA
 
I wiped the chrome off wit the dust cloth 
Fore I bust off
What's the cause, life loss, high price to pay
For a small reward, kill for that Bushwick and Horsely broad 
I provided the jump cables, through to boost the mini-pack 
Based on the drama unfolding in a track 
I dont' hold back, I spare no one
Swords swing like shogun, now who want it? 
You see the truth, then act upon it 
Or feel the fire's fore view
Ain't a MC that I hit can pull through
That niggas are like kid, flashin plastic tools 
Unaware of the most-year dynastic rule, what stupid!
High Price, Small Reward
 
[Masta Killa
 
Without a doubt, it's in the heart where the best darts were written
Sittin at the window of the grand old earths 
Youths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat 
Cuz some savage niggas are lost beyond reach 
Broken homes breed seeds of no guidance 
Left to wonder the streets and experiment wit devilish men 
Violent, felon offenders, supreme folders 
One-twenty bomb holders let em off and explode 
The battefield haunting the daunting 
Wu-Tang dance deadly emits six pence 
Spiral rifle, barrel pointed, elastic noose 
Plastic head wrapped stifle, survival 
Tribal, title secret rival 
?Archual? subliminal message throwin 
Bitch niggas holdin on labels 
Mic cables, capable of slowin down jets on deck 
Fuckin you straight through continuously 
Justice, wit more of the critical penital 
Some long overdue, now served by the chiefs on cheat 
Drummer bills is the street prophecies fulfilled 
Better chill, currents to the invited 
Bang for the phones, live niggas on they way home

[GZA
 
An MC stepped to me, lying about one 
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome 
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory 
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical 
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful 
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food 
Microphone competition we devour 
You pull plugs but take no source of power 
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land 
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G 
My rap flow automatic and never empty 
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother 
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D 
So when we throw those grenades you better be 
Ready, not iced out and petty 
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on 
The strength cause local niggas be hating 
But the sound still travels from state to state and 
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal 
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto 
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it 
Mix that [shit
, y'all niggas can't do [shit

How come so much rap [shit
 sound so similar 
Is it confusing for you to remember the 
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators 
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats 
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat 
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps 
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized 
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme 
Exert maximum damage in minimum time 
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit 
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas 
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length 
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th 
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift 
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores 
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm 
So think about it when you trying to flow 
When you wanna step to us I think you should know

[GZA
 
I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did, and for don'ts, I said I won't
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn 
and ripped up, stripped up, shacked up and backed up 
from fiends, cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up 
Kids are slingin in my lobby 
Little Steve and Bobby 
Gettin paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide and seek 
The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep 
Grown folks say they should be out on their own 
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fuckin hectic 
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected 
My lifestyle was so far from well 
Coulda wrote a book with a title Age 12 and Goin through Hell 
Then I realized the plan 
I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin stunts
Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol 
Stickin up Pamela and Crystal 
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest 
kid come home from doin the bid and nuthin changes 
What is the meaning of CRIME (what?) 
Is it Criminals Robbin Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime? 
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard 
Tryin to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard 
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow! 
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down 
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like an umpire 
But it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist
Only the players change, so...
I Gotcha Back

I will take vengeance upon my enemies.. 
And I will repay those that hazed me..

About to start shit that'll attract the flies
And then you hear lies, followed by some cries 
It's about to be, a catastrophe

Half of these rap lyrics ain't thoughts prevoked
Just alotta beef, til they get caught in smoke 
But the problem is never cured, on top of that 
Most of them be swingin' wild and then drop the bat
Many curious spectators, watch the human drama 
This rap cat was all in the street without his armor 
A homicidal attempt, that had failed 
He flew off the roof, on the fence, got impaled 
He talked a good one, but it was make believe 
Much too low, for the human ear to perceive 
He confused science fiction with science facts 
He couldn't separate the block, from the recorded tracks
Need a rhyme or the tactic, gotta work your magic 
Detailed and graphic, but the outcome is tragic 
Something built to a complex network 
With a panoramic vision, designed by experts 
I be the ice breaker, for you unskilled skaters 
I increase the heat significantly, just on paper

No matter what, I'm throwin' an iller dart
I can lay a verse, that'll soften a killer's heart
As fire as a five alarm blaze, that's too hot to be holding
You feel the heat, once the flame pumps lace your clothing 
What some talk about, had little or no bearing 
Could the next be some real shit, that's far from comparing
Materialistic M.C.'s, come off boring
Meanwhile, I be sketching up, deposit drawings 
Through the years, a countless, number of victories 
Changing the era, we swarm unpredictably 
A rhyme book is not, difficult to manage 
I leave a mic in a bandage, from catastrophic damage 
Rap niggaz on a trip, gotta steal your sandwich 
So I creeped, division reports was left on canvas 
I made it through the worst extremes of cold weather 
Scuffed up, but remained durable as old leather 
But I hold the pen, you feel the whiff of Polo wind 
Something like Jesus, when he civilize older men 
The math that shed light, all across the borders 
If our wisdom was the vast expands of fresh waters

We call it a sword style, because, we are lyrical assassins 
And we aware that the tongue is symbolic to the sword 
The lyrical assassins... the lyrical assassins... a sword style...

Move the knight away to deliver a discovered check from the queen 
Then, sacrifice the queen to force the rook next to the king 
Then mate with the knight)

It was the summer of 77.
NewYork was just recovering from the raves due to the blackout. 
HipHop was young and growing rapidly, it was during that time when my father would oftent make journeys accross waters. From Shaolin on his [not clear?
 to where many say this art form started. The ferry, or the boat, as most called it, was a floatin' forum, for talent especially MC's, who would often battle while in route to the city. It was on the boat, where he would sharpen his sword on neighborhood MC's, preparing for the battles that were soon to come...

"Legend of the Liquid Sword
 
[Verse 1: GZA
 
Who won the covenant role, based on a nationwide poll? 
For the grip tells told and rap scrolls 
Perfect pitch for language that's built within
Where half the rap ink couldn't hold my pen
Meanin' When Emcees Came, To Live Out The Name
They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain 
Far removed from this hip hop life off course 
But the confidence and resilience was never lost 
In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks 
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back 
Destiny forever shake from the events to come 
From the (?) and the chemical contents of the sun 
A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters 
Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter 
They joined in a likely alliance with the rest 
Schemin' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest
We all see, with a degree of certainty 
Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be, 
(Yeah, yeah...) 
They hunt, for the skin, flesh, the blood, and bones 
In front, want to impress with studdes stones
Legend of the Liquid Sword
 
[Chorus: Anthony Allen
 
Now who's the man who brought you the Legend of the Liquid Sword?
Rap critics say Damn you\'re sick with your\'s 
4th Chamber and the Shadowboxin' too
That Nigga be the GZA from Wu 
And if you odn't know
About the piroclastic flow 
Hotter than the spark that made it blow 
You better recognize, recognize....
Legend of the Liquid Sword
 
[Verse Two: GZA
 
Why U-N-I-verse run like clock works forever? 
Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather 
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A story with no warnin' you're drawn in, environments
Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debree
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee 
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars 
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar 
From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes 
That travel in a circle of order 
Like the tape in your cassette recorder filled with cult for slaughter 
(Yeah, yeah...) 
Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work 
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks 
Inspite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance 
on his target through a crowded market 
No interference 
The microphone left on the scene without a serial 
Evidence consistent with organic material (Well) 
Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree 
Till it spread widely

Life of a drug dealer
Life Of a Drug Dealer
 
There's a rumor that an old lady heard a
Kingpin hiring a hitman to murder 
A federal prosecuting drug-dealing witness 
But that's how it is in the business
And I'm in it, physically gaining power
Constantly counting up cash by the hour 
And it feels good to be paid 
Regardless of how many victims get slayed 
Accomplices of mine drop like flies 
But in this everyday a homeboy dies 
Whether shot in the body or cyanide in ya Bacardi 
Cause it's a cutthroat party
Now it's up to me to retaliate
And if I score, I'll increase the murder rate
I move on ones who double-cross 
Set them up, now they suffer the loss 
Of he or she who's ever on the agenda
Most likely a family member 
Informants, rattle-tattle-telling snakes 
Get shot up, brutalized and thrown in lakes 
The parts of a body is found days later 
The other half was done by an amputator 
I'm undefeated in plenty fights
My enemies are beaten with many stripes 
I'll shoot up funerals, firebomb wakes
Vehicular homicides, whatever it takes 
Just to keep control of my empire 
I'll set ya own mother on fire
Cause when it comes down just to me and my money
Ain't a fucking thing funny
All those who pose a threat I'll stick them
Ya friends, ya family and innocent victims 
Get caught in the midst when I'm busting of nines
But they was in the wrong place, the wrong time 
Decapitated bodies found in lots 
While I'm still cooking up kilos in pots
The kilos becomes bricks and the bricks becomes rocks 
Then retailed on the blocks 
I drive around in expensive cars 
And get women who fuck like porno stars 
I get them high, you know, like powder they nose 
Then put em in the streets as my high-class hoes
I'm wild, living foul and I'm ruthless
I leave muthafuckers toothless 
I had a worker who stepped on the scene lively 
Then started selling my customers Ivory 
Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks 
I stuck em to death with a thousand thumbtacks
You've seen my resume, that's just the half
I'm a bad muthafucker, just like Shaft
A character played by who? Richard Roundtree 
The only difference, my guns are sound-free 
Silencers ring off then wisp by 
Then all you hear is a last minute cry 
Of those who tried to control my territory 
Not the West Side but the Bed-Stuy story 
Police be giving me eye-to-eye contact 
But I smile cause I'm putting out contracts
Now a G-note is placed upon ya head 
You say picture that alright, bang ya dead

When I was little, my father was famous 
He was the greatest samurai in the empire 
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of 131 lords 
It was a bad time for the empire 
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out 
People said his brain was infected by devils 
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings 
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem 
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house 
They were supposed to kill my father, but they didn't
That was the night everything changed
Liquid Swords
 
See, sometimes 
You gotta flash em back
See, niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm sayin  we gonna take y'all back to the source

When the MC's came to live out the name
And to perform, some had 
To snort cocaine, to act insane 
Before Pete Rocked it on 
Now on with the mental plane, to spark the brain 
With the building to be born 
Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut
Liquid Swords
 
Fake niggas get flipped in mic fights 
I swing swords and cut clowns 
Shit is too swift to bite, you record and write it down 
I flow like the blood on a murder scene 
Like a syringe, on some wild out shit to insert a fiend 
But it was your OP to shop stolen art 
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
I put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt 
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
That's minimum and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble 
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt 
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts 
That attack the mic-phones like cyclones or typhoon 
I represent from midnight to high noon 
I don't waste ink, nigga, I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink 
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Through clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed 
Only under one circumstance, that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my Clan in Da Front want it

Now, when the MC's came to live out the name

Yo, the RZA flip the track with the what to cut

I'm on a Mission that niggas say is Impossible
But when I swing my swords, they all choppable 
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper 
Child educator, plus head amputator 
Cause niggas' styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers 
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak 
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law 
I be justice, I sentence that ass two-to-four 
Round the clock, that state pen time, check it
But the pens I be stickin' with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL 
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep, it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin 
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

"Living Foul
 
[GZA
 
Such a shame, such a shame 
Critical...
Living Foul
 
You're living foul, things are getting wild
It's difficult to raise a child
Cause growin up in a lost environment 
Every day becomes a new experiment 
Now we are faced with problems 
But if we come together we can solve them 
Before we start to solving, here's a sample
Who's coming foward to set the example
Inflation, starvation 
Surviving takes a strong nation 
Those who like to bring about static 
Be aware of the true Asiatic 
What you see was predicted before 
We were already warned of this bloody drug war 
Wherever you sell it wherever you go 
Ya still being clocked by the cops, ya know 
You're paid by the hours, they see time flies
While your brain's being showered by a bunch of lies
You say I'm no slave where's the lock and chain
Hmmm, on your ignorant brain 
Skip to ya loo with your High Pro Glow 
Ya not stim off life, ya stimulated off blow 
Or the new improved, ask beaming Jack 
Criza, criza, crack
Living Foul
 
[Chorus: GZA
 
You're living foul, living foul
Living Foul
 
[GZA
 
My people you were forced then brought 
Stripped from your jewels brainwashed and then taught 
To hate, deceive and dislike each other 
Separating themselves, you're not my brother
Sit up at home for a mystery 
Face-valuing things that you can't see
Can't taste can't smell, hear or feel
But senses prove everything is real 
I'm here to present a positive way
If strong you'll accord if weak you'll stray
Drug users are stuck in the mud 
Another 20th century modern day chud 
These cannibal humanoid undernourished dwellers 
Just took your check to the heroin cellar 
Dope addicts, that walk and roam 
Might have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
AIDS, doesn't come from me
Cause I've studied and learned my history
It had to be something evil to bring that about 
This is showing and proving beyond a shadow of a doubt
Living Foul
 
Chorus
Living Foul
 
[GZA
 
When you wake up, to a brand new day 
And you think about your salary or your pay 
You think of negative things, should I get involved 
Caught in crime, serving time, that's problems to solve
So you think about it, say that you must quit 
Smoke a blunt, then you do the same old shhhh 
And while ya high you don't truly know why
You spent your cash so that you can buy 
Some herb (word) and some Old E (yeah) 
A fifty cent Philly so the herb can be 
Rolled up modern style to what we call a blunt 
Know the facts is true don't try to front
Or stray away from the positive message in the song 
That's only showing and proving you're not strong
And the strong is what we need today 
Why? They go the opposite way
Living Foul
 
Chorus
Living Foul
 
[GZA
 
The words right now flowing off my tongue 
Is for the old, the young, the one's that's strong
Those who are worshippers of diamonds and gold 
You should not be bought and you should not be sold 
Those who always want but does not need 
is slightly controlled by the hands of greed 
If you rob, steal, backstab and abduct 
Sooner or later you will self-destruct

If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs

Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws 
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor

Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor 
DJ the getaway driver 
Tried to dip but he dive I socialize on vocal vibes 
On tracks stabbed up with razor sharp knives 
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it 
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate 
For fat tapes and then played out and out of date 
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate 
And from that point, the God made a statement 
Draftin tracements, replacements in basements 
Materials in sheet-rock, to sound proof the beat box 
And microscopic optics received through the boxes 
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical 
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from glocks that attract cops 
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop 
But we only increase if everything is peace

[Intro: GZA
 
This is a tale of a town with the population 
Of approximately two thousand people 
They small close in their community with crime 
And murder, we're virtually unheard of
With front doors, were always left unlocked 
A place where mayhem only happens in your wildest dreams 
Boy...
Luminal
 
[GZA
 
For some, the sun will never come out tomorrow 
Like those in this heart pounding tale of random horror 
Of a body count, after trashin' it, they done with it
Victims inflicted with passionate punishment 
Specific offers of horrific torture 
That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers 
This ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down 
Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town 
Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked 
Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks 
As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney 
So his child passion became a life long journey 
Grew into a world of destruction, abduction 
Left many body parts flowin' on the Hudson
Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched 
Screams is high pitched from scars you can't stitch
Mutilated and decapitated, white collar chicks 
Just from his involvement in local politics 
His outfit stained with the blood of the slain 
While his backyard full of skeletal remains 
His goal in life, was preparation for death 
An autopsy showed affixation, loss of breath 
Was it his fascination, for strangulation 
The lynchings in the 20's was his inspiration
Unspeakable acts that made front page 
Motivated by an unexplainable rage
Luminal
 
[Interlude: samples
 
A suspected killer plaguing this community 
Has once again eluded police and detectives 
We have no leads, no photos, no suspects 
This nameless, faceless murderer 
Has killed a couple, execution style, in their own home 
Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat 
We have no leads, no photos, no suspects
Luminal
 
[GZA
 
The State psychologist, forensic pathologist 
Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious 
They ruled out the possibility that the killa be 
Physically fit with athletic ability 
Talley and murder, on his agenda 
There was no word, and it\'s code for surrender 
So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion 
Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion 
Compellin' evidence, statements from residents
Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence 
From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire 
The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva 
DNA directly linked to the psycho 
Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0 
For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved 
A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve 
The bullets had names that made the frames shatter 
Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter 
Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime 
Made a hard discovery from one of many signs 
While questionin' a man he picked up on a scanner
He reacted in a loud and agitated matter 
And once they tried to read him his rights 
He turned cold as ice

Break beat fanatic, crates deep in attics 
Forty-fives marked up, looped with static 
Rap ring heavy, each link in my chain, trucks Chevy 
Flare ripped from the magic lair, of medley 
But deadly I merge foward, with a sharp spear 
He must return now his flight departs here 
Like Sittin Bull, I lay with my bow pulled 
Arrow poisonous cos my enemy clip's full
Stay in the venue, with the party promoters, life parolers 
Half the crowd wild, 9 m&m holders 
Apply boulders, smash your allied soldiers 
Intimate footage roll off the cameraman's shoulder
Many-a-die for fame movin like Leroy 
Can't be one and the same, nah it ain't b-boy

Clips are uncut episode, invinciable armor

Rakeem is feelin lovely, word, a pocket full of dough 
A little drunk, reaction's mad slow
Thinkin, should I go to the club scene 
And do what? And bag a rub-a-dub queen 
Another thing, beyond the CREAM, I wanted to get ripped 
Put my lips on a blunt tip 
It's been two weeks, since I last sparked it
Went down to the club floors 
Five dollar fee, plus ID 
But a brother like me, gets his way in for free 
Word, took a bar seat 
Got a tall glass, of sex on the beach 
Turned to my left, saw this girl she was slammin, son 
Oooh, what ya do kid? I examined her 
Pushed up, I tried to bag her, for her name 
What happened? I didn't have the game
Overwhelmed, by a scent in the air 
Could it be? Yes, yeah, a potent bag of sess there 
It was Raekwon and Loungin Lo 
They had a bone (you mean a blunt?) A palmetto 
I said pass the bone, pass the bone 
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone 
They passed it, took one pull I was blasted 
Felt kind of stimulated, fan-tastic 
We approached the weak cypher 
Did you surprise her? I tranquilized her 
Bagged her, for her name and address 
Slid to her rest, acheived mad success 
But did you bone her? Did I bone her? 
Did I bone her; you shoulda heard her moan
Pass The Bone
 
Pass the bone, pass the bone 
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone 
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone 
Yo Genius, flip the micraphone

Yo, pass the bone, kid pass the bone 
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone 
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone 
Pass the bone so I control the microphone
Pass The Bone
 
Yo check it 
Outside a nightclub what? We shine some young bloods 
Drinkin forties right down to the suds 
Ready to flow inside and rip the mic phone 
Hmm, and all I needed was a sess bone 
And guess who come down the block stumbling drunk 
Ason, with two bags of skunk 
Pull out the blunt put the weed inside 
Roll it up tight, then the flame was applied 
Inhale, but not pertaining to cough 
Exhale, you know like two pulls and off 
Stimulated kind of toxie 
Seen a girl who was foxy, yo but she needed 
OxyWash, oh my gosh, yo not to disrespect 
But back to the subject 
The brothers rolled up on the scene that I had known 
Smelled the skunk and said Yo pass the bone! 
I said, Lounge G there\'s not enough to pass around 
So go get a bag from Uptown 
I gave a pound to the brothers who was sweatin me 
What about the Wisdoms? Yo they was stressin me 
Hey Genius, Genius, when ya Come Do Me 
Step to me, you know screw me 
Just another red bone, that I had bagged in the red zone 
And took home to get my head blown 
Forget about the weak cypher, so I slid to the back 
Leavin tracks of smoke stacks 
that originated from the sess crops 
Give me the mic and watch me get props
Pass The Bone
 
Pass the bone, yo, kid pass the bone 
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone (6X) 
Pass the bone, so I control the microphone

When I hold a mic in my hand, it's devotion
Then I began flowing in a smooth steady motion 
Cause I'mcontended to know that I've invented
Poetry which has been highly complimented 
Thus how I rhyme is what I feel on stage 
And from a fraction of a thought I can write a whole page 
I'll just pull a notebook from off the shelf
And like Salt-N-Pepa I express myself 
To make most of you know me, and some of you don't
But when it comes to cold challenging, I bet none of you won't
Arrange a battle, improve your style 
Against a brother with a totally different profile 
Most of you flake cold front ya flex 
And hesitate on rhymes that should've been Memorex
But you forgot I remember you're an amateur
Mystery worshipper, nowI prefer 
ThatI remind you or tease ya on who's the boss
Cause you suffer amnesia, that's memory loss
Well get this just as quiet as it's kept
MC's on the chart from teh start has slept

You're a sneaky littlesnake in a devilish form
But as they say, yo, to each its own 
And to each one who plays with a microphone 
Abbreviate microphone and M.I.C. 
Meaning what, Myself, I, you see 
I invite those to battle me then they're through
Bust it, i'mnot prejudiced you're invited too
The rap convention or the MC show 
I have rhymes to block those who hit below 
The belt, that means biting a rhyme 
Yes, I'll wax you, tax you and plus save time
Now who is known to uphold his own 
And words are heard like a strong baritone 
Freestyle techniques that's wild and bold
That'll smile in your face and still come so cold
That I'll freeze you to the point of non-defrost
Now you're trapped in the Land Of The Lost
Should I, could I, would I lose 
When it's a selfish sore loser like you I choose
To roll your big eyes and suck your buck teeth 
Because you're upset that you ever caused beef
Yo homeboy, I never meant to tease 
But it's a slaughter, can someone help him please
Feeling uncomfortable, then loosen your belt 
Once The Genius gets heated up, suckers will melt 
Then after ya melt, ya start dripping like water

They put competitors in a trance, y'all

They made children play and dance y'all
How dare ya mention you're an MC
When the crowd disagrees on who claim to be 
Cause your battle piece are the rhymes you release 
And that only make the crowd boos increase 
Hey, may I say I'll stay a DJ
MC who try to defeat me or portray 
One who claims he gain much respect 
But in a battle, straight up and down ya getting wrecked 
Cauise getting with me is definitely a slaughter 
Or diving in a pool head first without water 
So don't set yourself up to get brutalized
That only happens when you're not energized
Bit I'm so damn energized, I'm energetic
That I can wreck a microphone til it's pathetic
Oka, got it in your head, correct 
That I'm victoriouson any subect
You disbelieve, then huh, call the title 
Then after one rhyme you'll be calling me your idol
It's like..zap...another one on my jock strap
Now you walk around praising my name 
Cause i'm slamming and I make you feel the pain

She dated jolly green GIANTS, that, flew on JETS 
An A-list actress, who was never walked off sets 
She loved stuffed animals, especially BEARS 
Was a role model, like a CARDINAL to our peers 
A PATRIOTIC tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons 
A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a DOLPHIN 
When I met her, she was in drama school and wore BENGALS 
Drove a BRONCO, and she was far from star spangled 
Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills 
Raised buffalo's, cause she was behind them BILLS
Had a man who always roared like LION 
A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying 
Couldn't care, she was losing her hair, from depression
She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions 
I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed 
You\'re a ten-i-see you just need to TITAN your game 
Her ancestors were CHIEFS, who ran with running deer 
On the sail with the SEAHAWKS, who battled the BUCCANEERS 
The REDSKIN garments, was suede coat liners 
Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners 
They were hard working warriors, we call over timers 
Shot plenty arrows at COWBOYS and 49ERS 
Her interesting background, but quite unusual 
A great force grip, but out of bounds for a musical 
She told me to call her, if I came to town 
I started TEXAN her, soon as my plane had touchdown 
Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars 
She pulled up at arrivals, driving the JAGUAR 
Her BROWN skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven 
Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, was a RAVEN 
As we entered, I heard laughter 
She walked into a large living room, I went after her 
There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were VIKINGS 
Militant as PANTHERS, they're resemblance was striking
Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter 
Energized like phones that just came off the CHARGER 
I introduced myself to gain yardage 
Cuz anything less then smooth, would of been straight up garbage 
The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager 
Thought I rolled with robbers, STEELERS and panty RAIDERS 
She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season 
One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing 
I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined 
It would of been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line 
Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off 
One removed the lip gloss, like she was bout to lick all 
She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet 
Dying for me to PACKER, as she stroked my helmet 
And I was thinking these girls was SAINTS 
But it was first and ten, and there was extra walls to paint 
Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle 
Buckin' like a COLT, before I released them puddles
They spread EAGLES like wide receivers 
As I RAM them in the endzone, and they became true believers
Queen's Gambit
 
[Outro: movie sample
 
I be liking chess 
Cuz chess is crazy, right there, that's the ultimate
It's like a great hobby right there, playing chess
The board, the pieces, the squares, the movement 
You know, war, capturing, thinking, strategy 
Planning, music, it's hip-hop, and sports
It's life, it's reality

His autobiography had came to an end 
With the final chapter written in blood upon the skin 
From snakes, that was dirty as rodents 
Therefore to a starving one, the call for hunger is potent 
Some kids at a young age, their skull is fractured 
Their mind store the sickest images ever captured 
They draw pistols to resolve issues 
To give em a sense of closure to expose the brain tissue
The shells was evidence, of a violent event 
That left a young dealer bent, from a hundred rounds spent 
The lifestyle, is a thousand miles from a minister 
A small con game with something far more sinister 
Peer pressure got him moving faster, a paradise of mutation 
Open the gates of disaster 
And murder is not the only cold blooded crime

Cuz they don't have a problem with running up in ya house
And burning it to the ground, after the shit is doused

Cuz he hovered on the brink of death 
He wasn't living right before he left

Coming from a nesting ground, of those on the growl 
In a state of darkness, menacing on the prowl 
Local rivals and known competitors 
Who tried to stay clear from the, spying eyes of predators 
On the hunt, they constantly taught persistence 
Those with less heart, keep a respectful distance 
The pray, no, it's too hot, to lay in the street
They find shaded areas, a few feet from the heat 
Cuz if not, then, it will be costing one 
Who will soon evaporate under a scorching sun 
Cuz when the drought is on, it's little left
Then what lies ahead, dehydration and eventual death

Revealing all symptoms of drinking ninety proof 
The phone booth door is closed, the light is on 
The girlie just dialed nine-seven-zero porn 
She sit back, with her legs cocked in the air 
While her fingers do the walking through her knotty pubic hair 
Her eyes are shut tight, she moans and groan 
I hit the glass, Get the fuck off the phone! 
She jumped up and said, You just had to be the one 
to interrupt me when I was having so much fun 
I said, Hold up, yo, bitch you think it\'s cute 
To be perverted let alone a sleazy prostitute 
She said, How can you try to disrespect any female 
Or me and my homegirls just because we sell 
I said, Pussy? That\'s what you call it? 
She screamed out, You\'re god damn right you alcoholic! 
She said, This is a public phone and you do not run it 
I said, So is your pussy but can I use it when I want it?

I was in Times Square, loungin hard 
Me and the Prince Rakeem, you know the God 
Watchin females posin for a flick 
Thinking of who would be the first to turn a trick 
Yo Genius you see that? Yeah So what you think? 
Let\'s swing em to the nearest spot to have a drink 
I winked at one she said, Hi in a low pitch 
Rakeem started flowing and bagged the other hoe bitch 
Now we searchin for a zebra lounge 
to settle down, right in the heart of midtown 
Went to this place, called the Sting Pit 
Got inside and seen all types of shit 
Men who looked soft but acting wild 
Dancing to the beat, Ten City style 
Females who wore jeans that were tight 
With faces resembling transvestites 
Everyone in the bar gave my girlies mean looks 
As if they were fugitive crooks 
They smiled at me and the God, showin all thirty-two 
That's when I caught the clue
As this red-bone, who thought she looked fly 
Rolled up on me, and she said Hi 
That one little word fucked up the whole night 
Her voice was deeper, than Barry White 
I jumped up, and boy did I flip 
I pull out a nine and I empty the clip 
The place was flowin with crazy blood 
A little midtown massacre type flood 
And as we stepped off from the scene 
Here's the message I got from Rakeem
Stay out of bars (4X)

Yo god wake up G, wake up god

Stop the nonsense 
I see youngsters little teenagers 
Walking around with beepers and pagers 
And who's beeping them? Oh it's the boss
Making sure no one is taking a loss 
On his multi-thousand dollar operation 
But how does he thank them for their participation 
Whatever the pay, it's still not enough
Cause what they got into is some serious stuff 
Hours a day back and forth on the strip 
Sending customers far on a trip 
And this roots of all evil brings about war 
Cause you wanna open up another crack store 
Children can't play in the parks and things
Because a stray bullet might be headed for the swings 
You never though about that, oh I guess not 
All you thought about was owning your own spot 
To putting more and more people to sleep 
But ya heading for a pothole six feet deep 
You see the problem has gotten more serious 
and the community is getting more furious 
Get it deep in your head I told you so 
It goes way beyond just saying no

Remember Steve with the blue Jag? 
They found him cut up and stuffed in a bag 
He had his own operation uptown 
And there was plenty other drug dealers he would cut down 
In other words he was living foul 
Shootin up neighborhoods acting wild 
He said he had to protect his drug trade 
Which we manufactured throughout arcades 
He made sure his enemies felt the pain 
WHoever he felt was a threat, got slain 
Like Donna, who was only sixteen 
And she was employed on another drug scene 
She try to set up a hit on Steve 
But he sliced her throat until she could not breathe 
This is what happens when you deal 
You don't care on who you got to kill
I might walk outside and get shot 
Because I live next door to a drug spot 
And I don't need this stuff in my vicinity
Of me being shot for mistaken identity 
This is the stuff that Steve was on 
Now he's dead long and gone

I hopped on the train and cold clocked a chick 
Who looked good as hell but she appeared to be sick 
I would say she had to look as if she swallowed a worm 
Then again she could've swallowed several ounces of sperm
Giving me the eye as if I was the right antidote 
So I decided to swing a smooth episode 
While the train stopped at Grand Central turn 
Before I knew her name I was massaging her perm 
I said, My you look drunk, have you been drinkin alcohol? 
You got a fever here's an Extra Strength Tylenol
She said, Great a comedian, comic 
She leaned on me, I said, Please don\'t vomit! 
She said, I\'m not I just need some rest 
I said, A few more stops, The Genius house is best 
Got to my rest, her whole attitude change 
But deep inside, she seemed sexually strange 
Went in the room and she flopped on the bed 
With wild-ass thoughts inside her headachish head 
I went in the kitchen to prepare some food 
When I came back in she was completely nude 
I know it sounds weak but believe it or not 
That the fever in her head ran straight to her twat 
She was burning! Burning up out 
It took more, than firemen, to put that out 
And yo, I was hard, just as hard as a rock 
That I can hit a home run, with my cock 
She said, Let me show you what we do uptown 
I huff and I puff till I blow your balls down 
Wild as a wolf from off Wilderness Ave 
She said, My what a great big ahhh! you have

Did you ever know a girlie who just loves to switch 
From a Part Time Lover to a Part Time Bitch 
While she's loving part time, she's riding on mine
She says, I love you long as you keep making me feel fine! 
In her behind, vagina, or heated climax 
That I would sew, control, finger then wax 
Now she's swingin so low yo she flex like wrecks
Cuz she can set records on oral sex 
There's no lie what I said, she lives in the bed
If she got married, she'd be a worn out newlywed
And if she heard these words yo she would not cry 
Because sperm, the only damn tears in her eye 
Her drip-drop face is the one I painted 
Just stared in her eyes while she damn near fainted 
As she choked, goggled, then spit up 
Cuz cream, was flowing, all over her cup 
On the bathroom floor cuz her parents were home 
And I just could-n't tolerate her moans and groans
Genius, oh Genius, oh rock me so hard! 
Cuz I don\'t want to stop, I love you God! 
But there's one thing she could never erase
That the thing she really wanted just sprayed in her face 
So she regret, she ever swung low before 
But this little hot bitch comes swingin for more 
It used to be one, now it's five fingers of death
That rips her insides, as she gasp for breath 
To say, I love you! I love you! Forever so! 
I\'m getting hot getting hot let me blow let me blow 
What she thought was love, turned out to be lust 
That made her live by the laws, in sex we trust

Searched to death, on how living things relate 
Cause at a young age, I was molded in a religion 
I relied on - and got caught up in superstition 
Scared to split pole, duck black cats 
Once in a while, threw salt over my back

Made things seemed complicated now small like elves

Punishments that were set to wash the brain 
So look listen observe and also respect this jewel 
drawed up, di-tect and reflect this

What I'm about to flow on is so dope
The average hip hop fiend couldn't cope
Or explain my style because it's hard to define
So the fiend scratch and think and nod to the rhyme 
That I lay down in a straight narrow path 
While beats are just flowin' off a modern phonograph
Bass loud, high hats crisp and clear 
That'll never let a weak MC interfere
Or bring about some technical difficulties 
So I got prepared and I wrote these 
Rhymes That just broke loose from the brain 
Searching for dope beats on the same plane 
For you to write new rhymes it is a must 
But I come off with rhymes old as dust 
Even as a speck of dust it existed 
Ya got that? 
Forget it, ya missed it

That's me being played in April on the 1st day
Now who's a fool? What do you strive for?
Prime time juice on the box and fans galore 
Forget it, cause you're not hype as they want you
With a maximum of 200 your rhymin' IQ
Is 10, meaning thin, you'll never win
So erase that, I'm not gonna lose friend
I know you're gassed, ya charged, and kinda stuck up
But I define your challenge, a total fuck up 
And it's critical, a crying shame
How many MC's challenge me, and die in vain
But you should've came with ya whole rap
Community, now where's your unity
Cause what I see right now is you and I 
And you're too weak to stop me from doin' my
Damage, you know, type of body and fender 
NAH!, not the same way I did Brenda 
But you had the audacity to step to me 
Thinking you was Butch Cassidy and you could do me 
How can you do me when you don't know me
And out of the hip hop styles ya couldn't show me
One style that may have damaged me 
But that's something you'll never see

To bury MC's like a dog bury bones
And in this field, yo, I'm extraordinary
And in my back yard there's a cemetary
Of meek MC's who try to speak
And off preak technique that's soft and very weak
Yet they still have the heart to ask me to duel 
And like Mr. T, I pity the fool

That makes me stand out like men amongst mice 
So respond to the stimuli then fly 
Straight to the sky on a natural high 
Cause I'm the transmitter buck wild and bitter

Cause if it sounds tempting boy, I'll Double Dare you
And speaking of your low life, I won't spare you
Cause you're not worthy of the mercy

Those were the days, back in Junior High 
For an 8th grader, my style was kinda fly 
And just to prove I was an MC Pro 
I often sponsored a classroom show 
And the hype part of my imagination 
Was making my homeroom a hip hop station 
Minutes before the late bell would ring 
I would greet the audience and then I'll swing
A lyric or two as the students barked 
Beacuse my rhymes had sparked 
Off somethign causing the class to mingle 
To a rhythm which is now a 12 single 
Letting off many styles of hip hop 
Holding the mic that I made in wood shop 
Forget gold, my key chain was a cable 
Two math textbooks were turntables 
And for a mixer, something much cooler 
A penny being cross faded on a ruler 
Measuring dope beats that were flexed 
From hands that played a drum roll on a desk 
From my home girl, her name, fly ass Emery 
Sweet memory 
I remember sitting in my art class 
Drawing up lyrics kinda fast 
The outcome, a masterpiece 
Live shows with hyped up rhymes released 
As if lyrics were flowing from the heavens above 
I'll grab a mic and provoke a push to a shove
From boys and girls who broke necks to see

Now who wanna show and prove their MC skills? 
A brother stepped forward and tried to get ill 
But when it came time to live out his name 
He kicked rhymes that all sounded the same 
But I did him in with a matter of time 
And he was done with one victorious rhyme 
He was shocked because he knew he was rocked 
Along with his classmates from off his block 
YO!, I'm telling you, I flipped his whole crew
One against one or one against two 
Or three or four brothers who swore they can rhyme 
Battled me and got taken out every time 
From my style and my dope profile

Out and scream and shout, beyond the shadow of a doubt 
They don't know what it's about
Just to keep you informed with the significance 
How can I prove this through true evidence 
Some make me laugh, think they droppin' math
Show and proven is a difficult path 
Within teh five percent, I am the live percent 
Those who perpetrate are the jive percent 
I be the universal, the Biochemical 
Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head is the physical 
That keeps rhymin' until it's unbearable
No individual is comparable 
You have aproblem inform the technician 
But he's not dealing with those of superstition
Those who like dealing with it superstitiously 
Cross your fingers when you steppin' to me
I don't nee beefs and problems, riffs and static
Debates and arguments that snot dramatic 
I need action, it speaks louder than a word 
Especially when the word is loud and unheard 
Word is what? My word is bond, your word is bull 
Now it's your card I'm gonna pull

They had a citywide effort to keep us in the dark 
To the new details, distant wisp of light 
Evidence of a terrifying threats on microphone

Strands of heavy metal form the steel arch design 
Fit together seamlessly, everlasting rap 
Heat-pressure generated by a blasted cap 
The chamber when ya rollin' the dice everything count
Clan royalty where the loyalty is paramount 
Couldn't be more wrong prior to your perusings
When ya spoke of us, you understated the influence 
As I bury my motor-action, implode a fraction 
Of ya investigation when ya askin

The victim's dental records showed they loved to bite
The under like removed off a charged battery 
Someone had his ear stuffed wit the sweets of flattery 
A live wire, fired the shot in the booth 
It wasn't even in the shooting distance of truth
Who broke the barrier causing mass hysteria? 
At the darkest hour in the most densed area 
In a stocking cap, undercover, while disguising 
I'm rapidly advancing our horizons
This path of trade with the sharp blade, open to all across the globe 
They simply heard my call 
We hit up, the remote and primitive land 
Left walking reminders that saw it first-hand 
The music was a secure link we all think 
On the same page as holding the ink, now whatchu think?

[Intro: movie sample
 
We would drive them to the limit 
Drive the invading forces to the limit 
Where they lose their patience, and they will lose their hope 
And the day will come, where they are driven down 
To their lowest level and give up, this is the first time this Earth 
That the habitual, articulate, how they plan to try and win 
They plan to fight and do it here 
But making sure, that they're losing their patience
And that they will lose their hope 
The third rail will always live it to it's lowest level
Unprotected Pieces
 
[GZA
 
Due the hellish events, the days were numbered 
Agitated and withdrawn, the addicts wonder 
Moving through eternal hell, constantly beaming 
In the grips of evil, wrestling with their own demons 
An ordinary ride, extraordinary challenge 
That get caught between boroughs that was very hard to balance 
Where the shots got louder, witnesses kept silent 
Through those 12 terrain days of the summer, that stay violent 
Soldiers that'll grill, to the boss' desire
Captivated by the idea of speed and quick to fire 
Rushed, his orders came in a commanding tone 
Carried out, executed within a, battle zone 
Action, spoke louder than words, that made him walk 
Cuz these kids had came with more music, than less talk 
Thinkin' that they was bigger than U.S. Steel
They couldn't close a deal, without a cap to peel
But once the act of fear, is exceptionally calm 
With unanswered questions, what harms the firearm 
It beats killing the counter, horrific in it's own way
A groundbreaking case, that lasted for another day

Write off that unpredictable things could happen 
Well aware of the sudden danger, we start scrapping 
Violence can erupt within the blink of an eye 
As a three night reign of terror, light up the skies 
Other uprisings are in the years of making 
The young start sizing up the hood, and get to taking 
A high voltage power line, surrounds the gold mine 
Soldiers on the front line, who sell dimes and hold nines 
Many times enjoying themselves, much too much 
They hit the clutch, before they pull out on such and such 
It's a very unforgiving environment, cuz one out of two
Can get an early retirement, for many different reasons 
The tale of the tape, is uneven 
What they perceive as a prank, had stopped them from breathing 
He was known to run towns, and brutally gun down 
He said it was a great risk for him to be around

You're listening to slanged out goodies, and Timberlands and hoodies
With the rhythm that came from the streets
Unstoppable Threats

I was a young one at the time, but started Mic Trippin
Had rhythm like Ali, when he was rope skipping 
I got crazy, when I heard the break beat 
I used to lose it on niggaz on 4th and Main Street 
They couldn't stop the attack, once I moved forward
Many was drawn back, assault was seen awkward 
Only armed with the bow, and a mad flow 
Poisonous arrows on a mark, that was set to go 
Traveling at high speeds, towards a target 
I never hit bystanders in crowded markets 
Documenters catch this most intimate footage 
In the center they come close, label it the hooded 
Remarkable clips, of an uncut episode 
They was given the safe, but never was left the code 
Close up of those, who have paved the road 
Invincible armor like that nigga we call The Toad

Havoc on the block, shots from the ratchet, sizzle pop 
Slugs spinning outta control, body's drop
You know the saying in the hood, fuck the cops 
Certified on the clock, them ducks with metal glocks 
It takes place on the planet in rocks 
Take nothing for granted, raised by these thieves and bandits 
The enchanted, sticky green keeps my eyes slanted 
Hard times coming up in the ghetto, but the Sunn manage 
Watch me take advantage, get it, split it, panoramic 
The notes I quote, water like the great Atlantic 
Never catch me frantic, swift with the antics 
Bitch niggaz vanish, niggaz, they run rapid 
Sun of a Man, son of the sun, son of a gun 
Breaded from the slums of each one and teach one 
What's done is done, son, the game is made
Stay sharp like switchblades, continue to get paid

Young Gatling, strapping a .38 revolver 
It's going down, wait for the sound, my soldiers rally round
Ninja men, blending in, with the surrounding 
Nuff gunmen, nuff Flatbush yardmen strapped with the vest
No pussy test the God, the grounds is well held 
Illegal desert eagle, cadaver dog 
Search for the body that's lost, of course, it's BK
You heard niggaz got killed for sheik coats and big ropes 
Legendary students that sold coke, some blocks that's still hot
From shots popped back in 88
The black gate where son lay, never made the paper 
Just another caper pulled by a masked killer, broad day light 
Crown Heights, some are Fahrenheit, heat blazing 
Cops on the beat, stop the money flow of the street 
My dough is whole wheat, the fam gotta eat

Heavy foot traffic jam the hallway all day 
Adolescence workin for small pay 
World so little, he could never leave his block 
His home full of riddle, so he always need his glock 
He coast with his eye open, keep his metal smokin 
Young wasted minds, fiendin on dimes, cokin 
Forgot kids quick to break rules, and known to make fools 
out of many, down the streets be more safe than school 
There's no diploma, that can break him from the coma
A bloody war in the country, the youth hungry 
On the corner, hyenas amongst me 
Yabbin bout the stories, they be hearin, always swearin 
Can't even spell the shit that he be wearin
Caught up in the silk web of material 
Superficial stains ya brain tissue, that's the issue
The young is lost at their own cost, dreamin 
Screamin how we never hold positions, that's the meanin

The elderly shake their head in disbelief

some funny niggaz act like they could pop glocks and those who can't cop
Sisters givin up ass a lot, brothers givin up cash a lot 
They be strugglin to become someone because their parents not 
Just another victim of the ghetto, where lost minds settle 
When the devil uncivils society and die free 
With double W' followed by J-D around the necks
and wrists the God is now a dog, the earth is called a bitch 
and all my people wish to get rich in this wilderness 
To push a lexus, ice on everythin from rings and braclets to the necklaces

Thieves uneducated in these schools, paint on the ceilins 
Peelin off, but all I see is lost black babies callin

A slave of mental death of only she was divine 
Walking down my ex-block, the block Munroe 
I said, peace to her, the girl said hello 
Well hell is low and the lowest you can go 
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero 
So I started to rain on this young girl's brain
Causin her a great mass of physical pain 
She said, Tit for tat, step off my bra strap. 
No diamonds, no gold, you cannot get a rap. 
Then I said, So what? as I grabbed her butt 
She smiled for a while but her mouth kept shut 
The girl is eighteen, just birthed a child 
You're young in the brain and your thoughts are wild
You're on welfare, yo but you don't care
You say, FTF is always there. 
Yes FTF meaning face-to-face 
The main headquarters of your local place 
Where you collect your bi-weekly pay 
To support the foolish habits you abuse everyday

There has never been one who tried to disrespect 
Especially a member of the opposite sex 
Yo bust it, there's somethin that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Silly girls, they think guys are soft 
But all they wanna do, is knock their boots off 
And just from obtaining the common sense 
You can tell that the girlies seem rather quite dense 
Other than dense they play slightly bold 
But from the statements I made they could not uphold theyself 
They break down, and they start to cry and said 
Oh! I don\'t believe this guy!

But ain't satisfied until a pervert slice your throat
You're young you're dumb and you used to be innocent
when young, now take a look at what you've become
A bloodsucker, trying to get all you can 
Out the pocket of thenext girl's man
Just to clothe yourself in gold and jewelry 
You wear tight jeans with attempts to lure me 
Into your web, cause you're livin like a spider
And playin it off, like everything's Oreida
You come out late at night and roam the streets 
like thiefs, stalkin a piece of flesh meat 
Is that what you do for a living get paid? 
C'mon, there's plenty of ways to get paid
But instead of living the life that's clean and sturdy
You'd rather go out and get your knees dirty

Your man wants to beef, then we can do this 
Then when it's time for you to face the God

So sweet to biters it gives them cavities 
And can't be healer from the strongest toothpaste

You wanna try me, and be worn and torn 
Step forward, I'll get on and start to born

Make a sucker MC like you clap

You react like an infant respons to Similac 
Or then again, could have been Enfamil 
But for your information the rhyme is real

Tell you the truth it's just One Nation Under

But it's proper, only to those who understand
Why I walk on stage with a mic in my hand 
As brothers look on, label me as a psycho 
Just because I'll jump on stage and grab a micro-phone
From a so-called said to be MC 
Who admires me with jealousy and envy 
My rhymes are delivered with style and potential 
Words are flowin smoothly in a sequential 
Order, revealin hidden tape records 
Stuffed inside pockets and those I'll slaughter
But I don't get upset, when you bite and steal
I go home and write some ill 
Stacks of poetry, page after page 
Imagining the scen-ery onstage 
I catch flash-backs of the seminar 
As I crush the dreams of a wannabe star 
Self-explanatory words are shifted 
In a unbitten style cause I'm gifted
and talented, with the lyrical ability 
Bound to fuck up a hip-hop facility 
Damaging MC's who dare to enter
The center, then challenge the inventor 
Of an impartial rhymin status 
Followed a relevant apparatus 
The way I come off on the mic is attractive 
I can make a quadriplegic hyperactive 
With lyrics of friction causing mics to spark 
My style couldn't be bitten by a shark

Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game 
Whether broke callisthetic, any style you set it 
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses 
But with iron on the side thugs took no excuses 
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless

Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats 
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold 
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill

No time to swing the hammer that was hangin from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs 
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville 
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look 
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas layin on roof tops 
For his CREAM he stashed in a shoebox 
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers 
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets 
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate

Yo 
No time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs 
And seize packages and pocket the currency 
Clicks control strips full clips are sprayed 
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay 
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick up kids on the ground broke the staircase light 
And I stays harassed, scramblin for petty cash 
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learnin fast 
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, provide fire sparks for wars 
Hospital floors surrounded by the law 
Homicide questioning while the jakes guard the door 
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team 
Cause niggas main concern is CREAM 
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant 
Shot up the Chinese resteraunt, for this kid named Lamont 
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid 
And hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled 
Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast 
Cause the crime boss is passin off cash 
Extortions, for portions of streets, causes beef 
Havin followers of Indians trying to play Chief 
You witness the saga, casualties and drama 
Life is a script, I'm not a actor but the author
Of a modern day opera, where the main character 
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor
