911 
There's a riot in the kitchen and the bed's on fire
There's a locket in my pocket that I can't find
Oh I'm at the window whistling in the wind
I'm at my own front door and I can't get in
911
 
I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time, a little 
Then everything else would be 
Fine, fine, fine
911
 
Tell me do you have a home-made remedy 
The only time we talk is in your sleep 
Oh he likes mornings, I like the Moon 
It's a typical case of too late, too soon
911
 
I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time, a little 
Then everything else would be 
Fine, fine, fine
911
 
My back is in the corner 
My boat is taking on water 
You can't wrap fire up in paper
And you can't rap your way out of here
911
 
Oh I like mornings, he likes the Moon 
It's a typical case of too late, too soon
911
 
I'm dialing up 911

There's a riot in the kitchen and the bed's on fire
There's a locket in my pocket that I can't find
Oh I'm at the window whistling in the wind

I'm dialing up 911

If you could change the time, a little 
Then everything else would be 
Fine, fine, fine

The only time we talk is in your sleep 
Oh he likes mornings, I like the Moon

"Above The Clouds
 
There's a place where the sun breaks through
And the wind bites cold and hard 
Stings my ears and 
Tears my eyes 
When the day starts to shout out loud
Above The Clouds
 
Stand tall 
And glide 
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall
Don't hide
When you walk above the clouds 
When you walk above the clouds
Above The Clouds
 
When the light is against your face 
And your smile is soft and proud 
That's when you tell me all your fears
and all your dreams 
So sound
Above The Clouds
 
Stand tall 
And glide 
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall
Don't hide
When you walk above the clouds 
When you walk above the clouds
Above The Clouds
 
I try and tell you 
to keep your head upright 
Don't swing your sword and shield against the night
Don't block your blessings, boy
You don't have to fight
You don't have to fight
Stand tall 
And glide 
When you're all alone in the crowd
Don't fall
Don't hide
When you walk above the clouds 
When you walk above the clouds

"Across The Universe
 
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, 
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe. 
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy, 
Are drifting through my open mind, 
Possessing and caressing me.
Across The Universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Across The Universe
 
Images of broken light which dance before me 
Like a million eyes, 
They call me on and on across the universe, 
Thoughts meander like a restless wind 
Inside a letterbox 
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world

Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns

And Freedy's got spots from ripping off the stars from his face

"A Night To Remember
 
I look out my window 
Into the pouring rain 
I wish I could tell you 
That I stopped hearing your name 
And then I realize every thought of you 
Runs a circle around my heart 
I hear your voice haunting me 
I feel your touch in the dark
A Night To Remember
 
It was a night to remember 
All your kisses I still taste 
It was a night to remember 
Can't forget the look on your face
It was a night
A Night To Remember
 
Starlight send a message 
Like a beacon into the night 
To tell you I'm lonely
When I shut out the light 
Because a part of me left with you 
So I feel lost inside 
Sometimes I look into my mirror 
I see you shining through my eyes
A Night To Remember
 
It was a night to remember 
All your kisses I still taste 
It was a night to remember 
Can't forget the look on your face
It was a night to remember
A Night To Remember
 
All these feelings I can't erase
From my heart
A Night To Remember
 
Endless dreams 
Around my shoulders 
I cannot free this restless heart
A Night To Remember
 
It was a night to remember 
...Not enough time for you to stay... 
...Can't forget the look on your face

"A Part Hate
 
Somber sister 
This is a strange and bitter fruit 
Because you taught me to sing  
And the rhythm in my heart 
And the rhythm in my feet is -
A Part Hate
 
Why are the rainbows  
Stolen from the sky 
And locked up in boxes 
Yellow, black, red and white 
Like birds in their cages 
Beating their wings on the bars 
And there's a song that they're singing
It's a word in the world
It's a word in their hearts
A Part Hate
 
A part hate 
I heard a man say 
Tear apart hate 
And I saw hope in his face  
A part hate 
Where the color of love 
Slips away
A Part Hate
 
Why are the children 
Carrying guns, not books 
Drug dealing, not learning 
The golden rule 
And the idea of freedom 
Not just the same 
Castle in the sky 
Haunted by white-sheeted ghouls 
Filled with hate me 
And hate you 
And proud of it too
A Part Hate
 
A part hate  
Heard a woman saying 
Tear apart hate 
And I saw hope in her face 
A part hate 
Where the color of love  
Slips away
A Part Hate
 
Why are the people 
Running down the block 
Rock throwing, not knowing 
What else to do 
But I'm just a spectator
And I can never know the pain 
But when I hear 
That whip cracking 
I cry out tears of anger 
I cry out tears of shame
A Part Hate
 
A part hate 
I heard myself say  
Tear apart hate 
And I saw hope in my face

Where the color of love  
Slips away...

She used her body and supported me

And this was the cure 
So when a customer appeared I'd leave out bed
I'd go outside and I'd prepair some cheese and bread

Hello 
Cyndi Lauper : 
Sewed everything you said 
Together in a thread 
Repeating in my mind 
Each word like a rhyme 
Like a penny serenade 
Looking through his song 
He said the record's overplayed
But where did I go wrong 
Nellie McKay : 
You never stayed at first 
Could not commit the time 
Ignored all the quirks 
But he still did the crime 
And when he goes away 
I know you'll call and cry
Cyndi Lauper : 
And when he calls up to tell 
Now I'm gonna cry
Nellie McKay : 
But I know you're mine
When you're on the line
Cyndi Lauper : 
Is it something I said 
Nellie McKay : 
Would you let him walk away 
Cyndi Lauper : 
Got it stuck in my head 
Nellie McKay : 
Don't you hear a word I say
Cyndi Lauper : 
Is it something I said 
Nellie McKay :

It's ahhh, I'm waiting till my Joe comes home
Everytime he asks me how I feel 
When I tell him, the phone goes dead 
Nellie McKay : 
I'm the queen of QVC
You're leaning on my ear
You mean the world to me 
Though the connection isn't clear
Like my ink sputs 78's
Convenient when you're low

I left you this morning couldn't take anymore
You laughed and you dared me to walk out the door 
You said that I'd come back you knew what I'd do
And you know you were right cause I'm back here tonight begging to you

I won't disappoint you I'm begging to stay
That's what you wanted to hear anyway
It must make you happy to make me so blue 
What a pitiful sight I must be tonight begging to you

"Box Of Rain
 
Look out of any window 
Any morning, any evening, any day 
Maybe the sun is shining 
Birds are winging or 
Rain is falling from a heavy sky  
What do you want me to do, 
To do for you to see you through? 
This is all a dream we dreamed 
One afternoon long ago
Box Of Rain
 
Walk out of any doorway 
Feel your way, feel your way 
Like the day before 
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner 
Where it's been waiting to meet you 
What do you want me to do, 
To watch for you while you're sleeping?
Well please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming too
Box Of Rain
 
Look into any eyes 
You find by you, you can see 
Clear through to another day 
I know it's been seen before
Through other eyes on other days 
While going home  
What do you want me to do, 
To do for you to see you through? 
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon long ago
Box Of Rain
 
Walk into splintered sunlight 
Inch your way through dead dreams 
To another land 
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted 
With words half spoken 
And thoughts unclear 
What do you want me to do 
To do for you to see you through 
A box of rain will ease the pain 
And love will see you through
Box Of Rain
 
Just a box of rain  
Wind and water 
Believe it if you need it, 
If you don't just pass it on
Sun and shower  
Wind and rain  
In and out the window 
Like a moth before a flame
Box Of Rain
 
It's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it 
Or leave it if you dare 
But it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair 
Such a long long time to be gone 
And a short time to be there

From above or below ? ... oh no ... brimstone ...

As if her heart would never tire

And i say very low

Don\'t you ever let a man hit you, 
Don\'t you grow up like me

Ever if it meant I'd be alone
Ever if it meant I'd be alone.

Cause she looked like broken glass
When she fell to the ground 
I heard the sound of thunder

So everytime she got back up 
Like broken glass went tumblin' down

You looked so lost and kind 
Should have recognized that 
Troubled look 
From the road I left behind 
But I thought that I could comfort you 
Or was it you could comfort me, 
Never saw your anger till you blew
Never saw your anger till you blew

There was always hell to pay 
I could feel your darkness in me

And the rest I can't remember

But it could have been a firecracker 
It could have been a firecracker 
Made me run

"Code Of Silence
 
Everybody's got a million questions 
Everybody wants to know the score  
What you went through  
It's something you 
Should be over now 
Code Of Silence
 
Everybody wants to hear the secrets  
That you never told a soul before  
And it's not that strange 
Because it wouldn't change 
What happened anyhow 
Code Of Silence
 
But you swore to yourself a long time ago  
There were some things that people never needed to know  
This is one that you keep  
That you bury so deep  
No one can tear it out 
Code Of Silence
 
And you can't talk about it 
Because you're following a code of silence 
You're never gonna lose the anger You're never gonna 
You just``ea `wiel it a different way 
Code Of Silence
 
And you can't talk about it No you can't talk 
And isn't that a kind of madness And isn't that a kind 
To be living by a code of silence To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say When you've really got a lot to say 
Code Of Silence
 
You don't want to lose a friendship 
There's nothing that you have to hide 
And a little dirt  
Couldn't hurt no one anyway 
Code Of Silence
 
And you still have a rage inside you  
That you carry with a certain pride  
In the only part of a broken heart  
That you could ever save 
Code Of Silence
 
But you've been through it once 
You know how it ends  
You don't see the point 
Of going through it again  
And this ain't the place 
And this ain't the time 
And neither's any other day 
Code Of Silence
 
So you can't talk about it 
Because you're following a code of silence Following a code of silence 
You're never gonna lose the anger You're never gonna lose 
You just deal with it a different way 
Code Of Silence
 
So you can't talk about it No you can't talk 
And isn't that a kind of madness And isn't that a kind of madness 
To be living by a code of silence To be living by a code of silence  
When you've really got a lot to say When you've really got a lot to say 
Code Of Silence
 
I know you well enough to tell you've got your reasons 
That's not the kind of code you're inclined to break 
Some things unknown are best left alone forever  
And if a vow is what it takes  
Haven't you paid for your mistakes 
Code Of Silence
 
After the moment passes  
And the impulse disappears  
You can still hold back  
Because you don't crack very easily 
Code Of Silence
 
It's a time honored resolution 
Because the danger is always near  
It's with you now 
But that ain't how it was supposed to be 
Code Of Silence
 
And it's hard to believe after all these years 
That it still gives you pain and it still brings tears  
And you feel like a fool  
Because in spite of your rules  
You've got a memory 
Code Of Silence
 
But you can't talk about it But you can't talk about it 
Because you're following a code of silence Cause you're following a code of silence 
You're never gonna lose the anger 
You just deal with it a different way

I met a man who drew the line 
He couldn't cross his fear of intimacy
He just sighed 
Because he left behind all his fantasy

You start to crumble 
And you never know why 
Your tears never dry

There's a collision with what's inside
This ain't livin

You say you need a little time 
To heal from some romantic injury 
And I say fine 
But if you change your mind

We both fell apart when things got too rough 
I've learned how to give now, but what good does it do?
When no one can touch me the way you used to do
Down So Low
 
But it's not losin' you
That's got me down so low
I just can't find another man
To take your place
Down So Low
 
Now I know that your opinion of me isn't too good
But please try to understand I would change if I could 
And now this coldness inside is starting to build 
A woman can't be a woman unless she's fulfilled
Down So Low
 
But it's not losin' you
That's got me down so low
I just can't find another man
To take your place

Watch them dancing all round the Christmas tree ...

Wait and see what Santa's bringing

And two i would put on your pillow with a lullaby

Someday we'll be watching the clouds as they're drifting away

"Give It Up
 
Pressure on me  
Can't get out 
Situation it's a melt down 
Nine to fiving, want to shout  
New direction, got to get to high ground 
Give It Up
 
I've got to get back to the floor 
Just grab my keys and pop the door..

Going to give it up  
Get on down  
Little by little going to turn it around...

Wash the week out  
Of my mind  
Slap my face on,  
Now i feel sublime  
Put some sounds on  
To unwind

Unpacking winter clothes 
Searching for my hat 
I thought I left it by the door 
So I tore around the room 
Like a bird without a head 
I saw your picture waving back at me 
From underneath the bed 
From a long, long time ago

Was a hat full of stars 
The one I'll always treasure
The one that you wore 
You loved the look 
But you never looked inside 
You would have seen us there 
You could've seen far
You should've seen the magic
In my hat full of stars

I'm trying to live in the present
But I keep tripping on the past 
Finding out reality, well clarity 
Comes in dribs and drabs 
No we never had the time 
For everything we had 
So it felt like we had nothing 
That's what makes this hat so sad
It was a long, long time ago

When all we had 
Was a hat full of stars... 
...You would have seen us there 
You could've seen far
You should've seen the magic

And I think I might forget 
I wear my lucky hat 
Just like a crown up on my head - 
Cause all I have
Is a hat full of stars...

"He's A Rebel
 
See the way he walks down the street 
Watch the way he shuffles his feet 
My, he holds his head up high 
When he goes walking by 
He's my guy
He's A Rebel
 
When he holds my hand I'm so proud
Cause he's not just one of the crowd
My baby, oh he's the one
To try the things they've never done
Just because of that they say
He's A Rebel
 
CHORUS 
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be understood
And just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love
He is always good to me, always treats me tenderly 
Cause he's not a rebel, no no no
He's not a rebel, no no no, to me
He's A Rebel
 
INSTRUMENTAL
He's A Rebel
 
If they don't like him that way, they won't like me after today
I'll be standing right by his side, when they say
He's A Rebel
 
CHORUS 
He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel cause he never ever does what he should
And just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why we can't share a love
He is always good to me, good to him I'll try to be
Cause he's not a rebel, no no no
He's not a rebel, no no no, to me

Sheep dog standing in the rain, 
Bullforg doing it again, 
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles, 
What makes you think you're something special when you smile ?

Childlike no one understands, 
Jackknife in your sweaty hands, 
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years, 
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears.

Big man walking in the park, 
Wigwam frightened of the dark, 
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you, 
You think you know it but haven't got a clue.

You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me.

"If By Chance (feat. Wild Colonials)
 
It might just be too deep 
We've turned your love into a hate
I can't wake you from this sleep
I can't lure you with this bait
If By Chance (feat. Wild Colonials)
 
And when you're all alone at night
I feel for you, I fight the fight 
I need to know that where you go 
Is real enough for me to know 
If By Chance (feat. Wild Colonials)
 
And if by chance, I'd drown for you
Would you believe, at last it's true
That all my soul was yours to take 
Would you believe I wasn't fake? 
If By Chance (feat. Wild Colonials)
 
It might just be too late 
We've turned your heart into a stone 
I can't save you from this fate 
I can't help you be alone 
If By Chance (feat. Wild Colonials)
 
And if by chance, I'd drown for you
Would you believe, at last it's true
That all my soul was yours to take 
Would you believe I wasn't fake?
If By Chance (feat. Wild Colonials)
 
Blood is thicker than water  
That could be a bunch of lies  
What makes me think I ought to  
Hold reins on all the ties 
If By Chance (feat. Wild Colonials)
 
And if by chance, I'd drown for you
Would you believe, at last it's true
That all my soul was yours to take 
Would you believe I wasn't fake?

And if by chance, I'd drown for you
Would you believe, at last it's true

"If Could Turn Back Time
 
If I could turn back time 
If i could find a way 
I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay
I don't know why I did the things i did
I don't know why I said the things i said
Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside
words are like weapons, they wound sometimes 
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know i made you cry, but baby
If Could Turn Back Time
 
CHORUS: 
if I could turn back time 
If I could find a way, 
I'd take back those words that hurt you
and you'd stay
If I could reach the stars 
I'd give them all to you
then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
if i could turn back time
If Could Turn Back Time
 
My world was shattered I was torn apart 
Like someone took a knife and drove it 
deep in my heart 
You walk out that door I swore that i didn't care
but I lost everything darling then and there 
Too strong to tell you I was sorry 
Too proud to tell you I was wrong 
I know that I was blind, 
and ooh ..

"If You Go Away
 
If you go away 
On this summer's day
Then you might as well take the Sun away 
All the birds that flew in the summer sky 
When our love was new 
And our hearts were high 
When the day was young 
And the night was long 
And the Moon stood still for the night birds song
If You Go Away
 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away
If You Go Away
 
But if you stay 
I'll make you a day
Like no day has been 
Or will be again 
We'll sail on the Sun
We'll ride on the rain
We'll talk to the trees
And We'll worship the wind
But if you go 
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love 
To hold in my hand
If You Go Away
 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away
If You Go Away
 
Like I know you will 
You must tell the world to stop turning 
Till you return to me 
If you ever do 
Oh what good is love 
Without loving you? 
I can tell you now 
As you turn to go 
I'll be dying slowly
Till your next hello
If You Go Away
 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away
If You Go Away
 
But if you stay 
I'll make you a night
Like no night has been 
Or will be again 
I'll sail on you smile
I'll ride on your touch
I'll talk to your eyes
That I love so much
If You Go Away
 
But if you go 
I'll understand
Leave me just enough love 
To hold in my hand
If You Go Away
 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away 
Like I know you must 
There'll be nothing left in this world to trust
Just an empty room, full of empty space 
Like the empty look I see on your face 
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow
If you might have kept me by your side 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away 
If you go away

(Se você se for)
If you go away (tadução)
 
Se você se for  
Neste dia de verão 
Então pode muito bem  
Levar embor ao sol  
Todas as aves que voam  
No sol de verão 
E nosso amor era novo 
E nossos corações elevados  
Quando o dia era novo 
E a noite longa 
E a luz parou  
Para a canção noturna dos pássaros 
Se você se for, se você se for, se você se for 
Mas se você ficar 
Eu lhe darei um dia  
Como nenhum outro foi 
Ou será novamente  
Vamos velejar ao sol  
Caminhar na chuva 
Falar com as árvores 
E adorar o vento  
E se você se for  
Eu vou entender 
Deixe-me amor suficiente  
Para segurar em minhas mãos 
Se você se for, se você se for, se você se for 
Se você se for 
Como eu sei que você vai  
Você deve pedir ao mundo pra parar de girar 
Até voltar pra mim 
Se você o fizer,  
Oh como é o amor sem amar você? 
Eu digo agora, no momento em que se vai  
Eu estarei morrendo lentamente  
Até seu próximo oi 
Se você se for, se você se for, se você se for 
Mas se você ficar  
Eu lhe darei uma noite  
Como nenhuma foi antes 
Ou será novamente  
Eu vou velejar no seu sorriso  
Eu vou caminhar no seu toque 
Eu vou falar com seus olhos  
Mas se você for 
Eu vou entender 
Deixe-me amor suficiente  
Para segurar em minhas mãos  
Se você se for, se você se for, se você se for 
Se você se for
If you go away (tadução)
 
Se você se for, como eu sei que vai  
Não me restará nada no mundo para confiar 
Só um quarto vazio, cheio de espaço vazio 
Como o olhar vazio que eu vejo em seu rosto  
Eu tenho sido a sombra da sua sombra 
Se eu pensar que eu poderia estar ao seu lado  
Se você se for, se você se for, se você se for

"I'll Kiss You
 
Went down to the local gypsy 
And I handed her the same line - 
You know what I want from you
So honey won't ya gimme #9
Cause you know lately I ain't feelin so great -
Last time she gave me love potion #8 
And you know pretty baby how I think you're pretty smart
But one sip from this bottle and I'll tear you all apart -
I'll Kiss You
 
The gypsy told me that the first thing 
That would happen you get dizzy 
Second thing you better make sure 
That your boyfriend isn't busy
Cause you won't wanna eat
And you won't wanna drink
You won't wanna talk
And you won't wanna think
My mother used to tell me not to kiss on this first date 
This time when I see you, you know I ain't gonna wait!
I'll Kiss You
 
I'll kiss you
Gonna corner you and not let you go 
I'll kiss you
Don't tell me nothing - I - I - don't wanna know
And twidely-dee - and twidely-dum 
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
I'll Kiss You
 
Hopped into a taxi, and I told the driver 
Got to get me cross town 
Killed the bottle, started seeing double 
When the driver turned around 
And though I was a failure with love potion #8 
#9 was different and the hour's getting late
Now I'm standing on the corner
Everyone looks great to me 
And if you come and get me take me where I want to be -
I'll Kiss You
 
I'll kiss you
I'll kiss you
I'll kiss you

Is a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him shout so loud, 
Crying out that he was framed. 
I see my light come shining 
From the west unto the east. 
Any day now, any day now, 
I shall be released.

"It's Hard To Be Me
 
You see me everywhere, in my underwear 
You may wonder what i'm here to sell
But underneath my stare, i'm so naked there
There are secrets i'm dying to tell
It's Hard To Be Me
 
It's hard to be me
Nobody knows what it's like to be
The envy of mediocrity 
If you could see 
All my depth and complexity 
I'd think you'd agree
It's hard to be me, it's hard to be me
It's Hard To Be Me
 
I am up here alone, on my glamorous throne 
Want to thank all you people down there 
I was once an unknown, like you but i've grown
I have so much i'm hoping to share
It's Hard To Be Me
 
It's hard to be me
Nobody knows what it's like to be
The envy of mediocrity 
If you could see 
All my depth and complexity 
I'd think you'd agree
It's hard to be me, it's hard to be me

I guess you think that it's hard for you
Walking around in your leather shoes 
You don't know how i've sacrificed
To live this life, to look so nice
It's Hard To Be Me
 
It's hard to be me
Nobody knows what it's like to be

"Love To Hate
 
Fashion fascists out in droves, 
Some with powder up their nose ... 
And the money men who had to steal away. 
Telling stories who they've had.
Who's a no count, who looks bad.
Then they turn around and say how much they like you ... 
Like you ... Like you ? No.
Love To Hate
 
I love to hate you... I love to hate you ... I really do.
Love To Hate
 
Playing games with people lives 
Change the rules when stakes are high. 
All the vampires come out at night to play ... 
Things are different today, that is always what you say. 
Well maybe so, except for people like you ... 
Like you ... Like you ? No.
Love To Hate
 
I love to hate you ...
Love To Hate
 
Look around you can't look down.
You might miss out on what you think is cool ... You fool.
Love To Hate
 
You've decided who I am, in this brief experience
And if it's worth spending your precious time on me.
My friend Mel he could relate, 
Told me once I love to hate 
I get so hot the words get stuck 
Stuck like you ...  
Like you ... Like you ? No.
Love To Hate
 
I love to hate you ... 
It's not just the clothes that you wear
Or the way you do your hair 
It's just you.

Lyfe, it can shake ya, it can make ya  
It can bring ya to the brink of lyfe,  
It can shake ya,it can make ya  
It can bring ya to the brink

But i'm learning to time myself 
Turn it easy over,  
Put some spice back on the shelf, 
Lyfe
 
Like elevator buttons go on and on  
Doors that open and shut without a cause  
There's something greater than i dare to know 
Look at me, pull the thread on this sweater  
And watch it go 
Lyfe
 
Lyfe, it can shake ya, it can make ya  
It can bring ya to the brink of lyfe  
It can shake ya, it can make ya...  
The struggle hard and deep  
Of what i learn to keep along the way everyday,  
Little one, i take your hand  
And wonder how i'm gonna help ya be a man... 
And how i'll help ya understand... 
Lyfe
 
lLyfe it can shake ya,it could make ya,  
It can bring ya to the brink of lyfe  
It can shake ya, it can make ya  
It can bring ya to the brink 
Lyfe
 
Two steps forward, one step back  
Cover my mouth, choke  
And pull down my hat 
Lyfe
 
Into the seamless hope of an endless drive  
Clinging to the rhythm of a lyfe like stride  
White washing down trodden people  
They're displayed like a grand masquerade 
Making us feel better that we are brave 
Lyfe
 
Like letters that fade into dust  
Like harmony, kindness and trust  
Wisdom eluding me, wise guys using me  
Peace, pece in, peace out  
That's right. what s it all about? 
Huh ? 
Lyfe
 
Lyfe it can shake ya, it can make ya 
It can bring ya to the brink of lyfe.  
It can bring ya to the bring.. of lyfe  
Along the way  
Everyday, lyfe

What are you thinking when you're looking at me?
What can you tell me of reality? 
I'm only woman... not just a fantasy

Warmer than some color transparency

Was it some promise in your youth you made?

Does it make you feel power or are you just afraid of me?

Everytime i hear that marchin lohegrin

When i see somebody's brother take a bride
Weddings make s lot of people sad 
But if you'd not the one, their not so bad!

Another sunny honeymoon 
Another season, another reason 
For makin' whoopee!

It's really killin  that he's so willin
To make whoopee!

Down where the roses cling 
Picture the same sweet lovenest 
Think what a year can bring

He's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks

What's this i hear? well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee!

He doesn't phone nor even write
He says he\'s busy 
But she says is he?

Five-hundred thousand per

Says you pay six to her

You better keep her, i think it's cheaper

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say, 
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today, 
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

While shepherds watch their flocks by night, 
they see a bright new shining star, 
they hear a choir sing a song,  
The music seemed to come from afar.

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,  
Came to Bethlehem that night, 
They found no place to bear her child,  
Not a single room was in sight.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today, 
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day. 
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn, 
and in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

"Moonlight Shadows
 
The last that ever she saw him 
Carried away by a moonlight shadow 
He passed on worried and warning 
Carried away by a moonlight shadow. 
Lost in a riddle that saturday night 
Far away on the other side. 
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight 
And she couldn't find how to push through
The trees that whisper in the evening 
Carried away by a moonlight shadow 
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving 
Carried away by a moonlight shadow 
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun 
Far away on the other side. 
He was shot six times by a man on the run 
And she couldn't find how to push through
I stay, I pray 
I see you in heaven far away 
I stay, I pray 
I see you in heaven one day 
Four am in the morning 
Carried away by a moonlight shadow 
I watched your vision forming 
Carried away by a moonlight shadow 
A star was flying in the silvery night 
Far away on the other side 
Will you come to talk to me this night 
But she couldn't find how to push through
I stay, I pray 
I see you in heaven far away 
I stay, I pray 
I see you in heaven one day 
Far away on the other side. 
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five 
The night was heavy and the air was alive 
But she couldn't find how to push through
Carried away by a moonlight shadow 
Carried away by a moonlight shadow 
Far away on the other side.

"Mother
 
Over land and over sea 
She reaches out to me 
Weaving and threading the loom 
From womb to womb
Mother
 
Slaves and merchants 
Pilgrims and thieves 
Felt her hand and charted skys 
By following her moon
Mother
 
Mother ... Mother ... Mother ...
Mother
 
Some came and built with stone and bone 
Some planted fields on promised land 
And harvested their dreams, 
Then disappeared 
As generations lose their memory 
I'll try and remind my heart ...
And hope that it will set me free
Mother
 
Mother ... Mother ... Mother ...
Mother
 
Condeming my true nature 
I stood outside of myself ... outside of myself 
Conditioning is what made me 
Lose sight of myself ... lose sight of myself ... 
Lose sight

Ravens cry out, 
Tides pull in, 
Somehow she replenishes ... 
Giving birth again

By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed 
At the twilight's last gleaming?

Whose broad stripes and bright stars 
Through the perilous fight 
O'er the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming.

And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air 
Gave proof through the night 
That our flag was still there.

Far too soon under the scarlet moon ... 
Under the scarlet moon ... 
Say a prayer ...
Say a Prayer
 
So, what are you weaving there marionette  
Keepin' your balance by a single thread ...
Keepin' your heart strings tight and pure
All you can muster and nothing more and nothing more 
Until you're sore and still you're sore when do you soar ...
Sometimes justice is the line you walk or sign, 
But justice is complex and a matter of time 
Sometimes it's hanging in the balance or
Dancing in the shadow like a silhouette 
So what are you weaving there marionnette ... 
So what are you weaving there marionnette ... 
Say a prayer for all the souls in bloom cut down 
Far too soon under the scarlet moon 
Say a prayer, go on say a prayer ...
Say a Prayer
 
Some people get a sadness so long 
They just go on thinking it's a natural thing
Some people throw their hands in the sky 
And they wonder why god don't reply
Well it's strange, strange time all our friends
Dropping like flies everything that's come to pass
All the time we thought would last. 
Well I'll just button my coat and cover my neck
I got barely enough time to catch my breath ... 
All these pictures I can't forget ...
It can fill your cup with regret ... 
It can fill your cup with regret 
Say a prayer, for all the souls in bloom ... 
Say a prayer... Say a prayer ...

Longing and glad ... 
Excited at prospects,  
Humbled and mad

With a touch you might understand ...

Wound a little right. 
Have to throw these covers down  
To get some sleep tonight. 
Tuck my heart in your pocket.

And still cry out for more

And just because of that they're saying:

You all have heard of solomon 
The wisest man on earth 
He understood humanity 
And so he cursed the hour of his birth 
And saw that all was vanity 
How great and wise was solomon! 
And yet before the day was done 
The world could see where it would end 
His wisdom brought him to his bitter end 
How fortunate the man with none
Solomon Song
 
The next you see Julius Caesar, what became of him? 
They showered praises on his name 
And yet they tore him limb from limb 
Just when he'd reached the height of his fame
How loud he cried: You too, my son! 
And yet before the day was done 
The world could see where it would end 
His courage brought him to his bitter end 
How fortunate the man with none
Solomon Song
 
And now at least you see macheath 
His life hangs by a hair 
Yet while his reason still commanded 
There was no greater bandit 
Known or feared in all the land 
Then one day his heart was won 
And see, the day is not yet done 
And all can see where it will end 
His lusts have brought him to his bitter end 
How fortunate the man with none

"Take a Chance On Me
 
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line 
Honey I'm still free 
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down 
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown 
Honey I'm still free 
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie 
If you put me to the test, if you let me try 
Take a Chance On Me
 
Take a chance on me  
(That's all I ask of you honey) 
Take a chance on me 
Take a Chance On Me
 
We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together 
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better  
Cos you know I've got 
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you 
It's magic 
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair  
But I think you know  
That I can't let go 
Take a Chance On Me
 
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line 
Honey I'm still free 
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down 
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown

Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie 
If you put me to the test, if you let me try 
Take a Chance On Me
 
Take a chance on me  
(Come on, give me a break will you?)  
Take a chance on me 
Take a Chance On Me
 
Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know I'm gonna get you 
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you 
Let me tell you now  
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough  
It's magic 
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind 
No I can't let go 
Cos I love you so 
Take a Chance On Me

Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me

"Take Me Out To The Ballgame
 
Nelly Kelly loved baseball games, 
Knew the players, knew all their names, 
You could see her there ev'ry day,
Shout Hurray when they\'d play. 
Her boy friend by the name of Joe 
Said, To Coney Isle, dear, let\'s go, 
Then Nelly started to fret and pout, 
And to him I heard her shout.
Take Me Out To The Ballgame
 
  
Take me out to the ball game, 
Take me out with the crowd. 
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack, 
I don't care if I never get back,
Let me root, root, root for the home team, 
If they don't win it's a shame.
For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,
At the old ball game.
Take Me Out To The Ballgame
 
  
Nelly Kelly was sure some fan, 
She would root just like any man, 
Told the umpire he was wrong, 
All along, good and strong. 
When the score was just two to two, 
Nelly Kelly knew what to do, 
Just to cheer up the boys she knew, 
She made the game sing this song.
Take Me Out To The Ballgame

Caught up in circles 
Confusion is nothing new 
Flash back, warm nights, almost left behind 
Suitcase of memories 
Time after
Time After Time
 
Sometimes you pictured me 
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you said: Go slow, I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds
Time After Time
 
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time 
If you fall I will catch you 
I'll be waiting, time after time
Time After Time
 
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time 
If you fall, I will catch you 
I'll be waiting, time after time
Time After Time
 
After my picture fades 
And darkness has turned to grey 
Watching through windows 
You're wondering if I'm ok
Secrets stolen from deep inside 
The drum beats out of time
Time After Time
 
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me, time after time 
If you fall I will catch you

To this new land with my own two hands 
I have followed the sun away from Ireland, 
Now like the red man, here I stand.

Love is less kind than the twilight. 
And the passion for me once in your green eyes, 
Like the sunlight fades from sight.

Just when life should be resolving I'm back at the beginning
And it comes back to the heart

I'm not running, I'm looking
Did I tell you I've saved all your letters and cards
There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars

Do you remember when I told you all that I could and it seemed like too much 
Well I was living your life hoping you'd never fall
If I held on tight enough 
And letting go now is like a passport to anywhere 
With time on my hands I can make a new start

And gave me this ribbon of velvet brown

Married a cousin I didn't know
He'd fallen in love with my photograph
Oh why, worked harder then I could bare 
And he never seemed to care 
I bore his only son at the end of that year

Out in the desert of sand and dune

Who Let In The Rain
 
And I wonder who let in the rain 
You know without you 
I'm not the same
When love gets strong 
People get weak 
Sometimes they lose control 
And wind up into deep 
They fall like rain

"Wide Open
 
Used to stand in my doorstep 
I used to dance in the rain 
I used to cast out wishes 
That never came back again 
I used to sit in my garden 
With pretty maids in a row 
Silver bells and cockle shells 
Waiting to see where we're going
Wide Open
 
Wide open for anything 
Anything love would bring 
Wide open for anything 
Anything and everything
Wide Open
 
Same old scenery 
Made me real confused 
Tired of the same old feeling 
Of being lost and used 
I follow lonely footprints 
To see where they would lead 
Dreaming that they would take me 
Where i want to be
Wide Open
 
Wide open for anything 
Anything love would bring 
Wide open for anything 
Anything and everything
Wide Open
 
An air of confidence 
Is now in my stride 
I swing my shoulders gently 
My hips from side to side 
Now i live in the moment 
Where there are no regrets 
Now i keep my head up 
With nothing to forget
Wide Open
 
Wide open for anything 
Anything love would bring 
Wide open for anything 
Anything and everything

Another yaer's gone by
Since we said goodbye 
And I can hardly wait to have you come again 
I've been living by the phone
I keep your letters in my pillow case 
So I can hold you close pretend I am with you

Everyday is pale and empty 
When you're not here with me
I got your memory burnt into my brain 
I count the lonely nights until you touch me again 
My heart is pounding like an oncoming train

I want to have you so bad 
You know it's driving me mad
And I can't hide the way I feel for you
To feel your hand on my cheek 
To here the words that you speak 
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue 
my winter lover turn me red hot and blue
Winter Lovers
 
I need to steal your time 
Play it over in my mind 
Hide your clothes behind the firelight 
Wrap me up inside your arms 
And every kiss will melt my lips apart 
Till the minutes stop and swallow up my heart
Winter Lovers
 
When you go back to your world 
Does your head skip to me 
My head is swirling snow on my window pane 
I count the lonely nights until you mm... me again 
I love you just the way a moth loves her flame

I want to have you so bad 
you know it's driving me mad...
And I can't hide the way I feel for you

I wish I may I wish I might 
The first star that I see tonight 
..Another day, another night 
The broken watch that's on my counter
Makes me think I'm lost without ya

In the lane, snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight, 
We're happy tonight.

Here to stay is a new bird 
He sings a love song, 
As we go along,

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job 
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made,

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

Though your nose gets a chilling 
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,

As soon as you're born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all 
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all

They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool 
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't fallow their rules

When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career 
When you can't really function you're so full of fear

Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV 
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see

There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill

If you want to be a hero well just follow me
