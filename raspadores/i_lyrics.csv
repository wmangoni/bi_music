"117°
 
West bound ride thru Texas 
The sun here really burns 
Open up and try and beat the heat 
It still don't do much good
Kick back and endure it, a 100 miles ta go 
Take a break, get some shade,  
before we start up again 
117°
 
117, 117 
117 so I'm told I don't know 
117°
 
Sun's going down here to an orange sky out west
Got an open road, not a car in sight, I'm hammerin
Down the rest 
117°
 
I been thinkin bout the weather, 
it's been pretty good this trip,
outran a thunderstorm 
2 days ago, I did not expect this... 
117°
 
117, 117 
117 so I'm told, I don't know
117, 117

"14 Years
 
I try and feel the sunshine 
You bring the rain 
You try and hold me down 
With your complaints 
You cry and moan and complain 
You wine an tear 
Up to my neck in sorrow 
The touch you bring 
You just don't step inside to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head... that's what i say
You know... i've been the beggar...
I've played the thief
I was the dog... they all tried to beat 
But it's been
14 years of silence 
It's been
14 years of pain 
It's been
14 years that are gone forever 
And i'll never have again, well...
Your stupid girlfriends tell you 
That i'm to blame
Well - they're all used-up has-beens
Out of the game 
This time i'll have the last word
Hear what i say 
I tried to see it your way 
It won't work today
You just don't step inside to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head... that's what i say
You know... i've been the dealer...
Hangin' on your street
I was the dog... they all tried to beat 
But it's been
14 years of silence 
It's been
14 years of pain 
It's been
14 years that are gone forever 
And i'll never have again, well...
Let's get naughtier!
Bullshit and contemplation 
Gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth 
What would they say 
Well i'm past the point of concern
It's time to play
These last 4 years of madness 
Sure put me straight 
Don't get back 14 years
In just one day 
So hard to keep my own head 
Just go away 
You know... just like a hooker she said 
Nothing's for free
Oh i tried to see it your way 
I tried to see it your way...

"Far Below Me Now
 
As I sit inside this chair 
Looking out the window here 
I can see that it's all far below me now
It's so far below me now
Just a short elevator down 
Far Below Me Now
 
[<br/>, And I really do not care 
Looking out the window here 
Cause I see that it's so far below me now
And I see you looking there 
Taking in the big view here 
45 floors are so far below us now
Far Below Me Now
 
[<br/>, Well, it's so far below me now
It's just a short elevator down
And as quickly as you go up 
It just comes back down 
I can see that it's so far below me now
Far Below Me Now
 
[<br/>, Yes, those city lights they glare 
Shining through the window here 
I can see the traffic far below me now 
And the colors are so red 
In the headlights sit and stare 
I can see that it's all far below me now

And I was grindin' at you hard and fast
Burnin' down the rails, tryin' to heat the way
Haulin' ass and ridin' up the track
And laughing at the conductor 
Who was tellin' me my coal
It would never last

Up and quit before I came 
Ain't no empty cellar

Mama shave em dry
And raise a fever ice-down chill 
Waitin' at the station
With a heavy loaded sack 
Savin' up and holdin' just to spill
Shootin' my supply through my demon's eye
Instead of holdin' my time, I hope I will
