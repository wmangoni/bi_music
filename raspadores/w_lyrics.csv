Bad Boy
 
[Verse:
 
Money ain't a issue of mine
I need a man who can take over the spot of ya mind 
I need somebody with a strong bank plan 
I need a man who can with the third hand 
Bad boy hangin out in the club on dubs 
Reminiscin what it feels with a thug, playa what 
That's the kind i need in my life
That will make a sista feel right, ooh
Bad Boy
 
[Chorus:
 
I need a bad boy, to stay with 
I need a bad boy, to lay with 
I need a bad boy in a beater and tims 
Wanna a thug around then i wanna do it again
Bad Boy
 
[Verse:
 
I don't care what time it will be, like 2 or 3
When you bring that body next to me, that's what i need
We can do it fast or slow, and around and round we go 
Strawberries and ice cream, that's what he brings
But we never do the same thing, ya na' mean
That's the kind i need in my life
That will make a sista feel right 
Sippin champagne, shootin dice games, it don't quit
In the rain or a ninja doin tricks 
He's a thug and he's pretty
But he'll throw em' up quickly
I need a bad boy
Bad Boy
 
[Chorus: 2x

[Verse 1:
 
Ohh when we touch I get this feelin 
When you not around I feel so different 
In it a year whoa 
(I just can't understand what she says here)
Feel somewhat exposed, so intense (so intense yea yea) 
You got me spinning like a record 
When you bring ya pressure 
Such crazy measures 
Hard to let it go, so you need flow 
When you take control

[Chorus:
 
I know it right for me to be thinkin bout lovin you 
I can't tell my heart how to be
Is it cheatin cause I'm daydreamin
I'm daydreamin I can't stop thinkin bout ya
I close my eyes to be around you 
Things about you make me want you 
When I'm daydreamin
Daydreaming
 
[Verse 2:
 
When I look into the mirror 
I can't help but to catch a flash back
Body, it's time to flash
My system is on the go 
I can't pretend
You got me open for another round 
It's drizzling and it's raining now
I'm so in need and I can't contain
Cause you're bringin out the best in me

"Enough
 
It's crazy, I know just how you're feeling
So alone, hope it's gone til it's useless
Don't let yourself fall apart
Is not a movie, it's addicting like a drug
It's so scary, I won't let it bring me down
It ain't a beauty, and it's so emotional it's overwhelming
Enough
 
Don't be blinded by love
Cause enough's enough's enough's enough
Heard a million stories 
Enough's enough's enough's enough
You got to let him go 
There is no reason to love love love love 
Can't let him take control
It's only burning you
Enough's enough's enough's enough
It's tearing you apart
Enough
 
Lately I know at times you have been empty 
So lost without the calls it's confusion
Don't let it disturb your mind, oh no
You can lose it, I have seen it with my eyes 
It's abusive, and it comes in different disguises
Some excuse it, it can leave you so hurt and miserable 
Without a question
Enough
 
Can't be blinded by love
Cause enough's enough enough's enough
Heard a million stories 
Enough's enough enough's enough
You got to let him go 
There is no reason to love love love love 
Can't let him take control
It's only burning you
Enough's enough enough's enough
It's tearing you apart
Enough
 
I know love makes you do some crazy things 
First it plays with your emotions then you're stuck with the shame
It starts out cool, then it ends cold, 
And out of blue it winds up, it slaps you in the face 
I hope you will find someone that cares about you girl 
Who respect you who appreciates you and holds it down for you 
Gotta know how much you're truly worth
Enough is enough
Enough
 
Don't be blinded by love
Cause enough's enough enough's enough
Heard a million stories 
Enough's enough enough's enough
You got to let him go 
There is no reason to love love love love 
Can't let him take control
It's only burning you

Stay in my arms if you dare 
Or must I imagine you there 
Don't walk away from me

If I don't have you
I Have Nothing
 
You see through right to the heart of me 
You break down my walls 
With the strength of your love 
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will our memory survive

Oh I love it when you scream my name

How can we have peace in the middle east, when there's none at home?
How can we have understanding in the land, when there's none in the women nooo... and there's none in the man?

How can we heal the wounds of the world if we cannot heal our own? no... 
Where does this peace on Earth begin if not in the home?

Where do we go now? 
Do we let the devil win? nooo... Or do we get up and fight? yes... 
Yes, surely we know how to comfort all our fears 
Bring an end to the violence 
Bring an end to our tears

How can we heal the wounds of the world if we cannot heal our own? 
Where does this peace on Earth begin if not in the home? oooh oh yea

There's too much talk about it and too many walkers out here!
Tell me where is the love? Where is God in your life? 
To my left a woman abuses her children 
To my right somebody's beating their wife
Tell me where is the love? Where is God in your life?

You're un-beli-eva-ble
Unbelievable
 
Come see what I have found 
Second time around 
Love so indescribable 
I can't talk about
Makes me wanna sang 
Tears come to my eyes 
Can this really be for real 
I think love's arrived, aah, aah, ooh
Unbelievable
 
Never seen before, this life is from another world 
I was a woman scorned, until you came into my world (in my world) 
Little things that I can't see, true love's amazing
Unbelievable
 
You're like the unicorn in my backyard, just running wild
Or at thee end of a rainbow, a pot of gold, that I have found 
Like talking animals, my jaw just hit the floor, ooh
Unbelievable
 
You're un-beli-eva-ble
You're un-beli-eva-ble
You're un-beli-eva-ble
You're un-beli-eva-ble
Unbelievable
 
Good things go around 
Good things come around 
Out there in the universe 
Smiles take over frowns 
He's the perfect one, He's the moon & sun
Never thought I'd find him
Ain't nobody like him, ooh ooh hoo hoo ooh ah
Unbelievable

Used To Love
 
Now baby i been thinking bout how you been acting strange 
And baby i been thinking how so many things have changed 
In my life, in my home, in my bed 
Said i remember how you used to love
Used To Love
 
How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's ok
Drop the key on your way 
Catch a bus, ride the train 
It doesn't matter just keep going
Used To Love
 
Now boy i can remember how i used to foot the bill 
And yes i do regret the day i took your broke ass in 
To my life, to my home, to my bed 
Said that i must have lost my head
Used To Love
 
I guess you thought that i'd let you walk on me like the floor
I gues you thought that you'd keep tracking dirt inside my door
You got it all wrong 
It's been too long
All of the love is gone 
Now i'm singing you this song
Used To Love
 
How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's ok
Drop the key on your way 
Grab a bus, ride the train 
It doesn't matter just keep going
Used To Love
 
How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's ok
Drop the keys on your way 
Grab a bus, ride the train 
It doesn't matter just keep going
Used To Love
 
You must have thought that you were getting over for so long 
But i was giving you the chance to make things right from being so wrong 
But your time is up, took too long, i don't wanna hear it
Get your shirt, shoes, pants and draws up from outta here
Used To Love
 
Oh oh oh oh 
Wo oh ooh wo 
Woo woo oh
Used To Love
 
Like you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's ok
Drop the keys on your way 
Grab a bus, ride the train 
It doesn't matter just keep going
Used To Love
 
How you used to love, you don't love no more
How you used to care, you don't care no more
That's alright, that's ok
Drop the keys on your way 
Grab a bus, ride the train 
It doesn't matter just keep going

"When I See Jesus
 
I have seen a lot of changes in this world we're livin' in
And the positives are few and far between 
The hate, the greed, the jealosy, this world is filled with sin 
But a better life's remaining to be seen
When I See Jesus
 
I have seen a lot of dissappointing things in my own life 
It's impossible to do what's right it seems
It's grieving me to see in our hearts bitterness and strife
But a better life's remaining to be seen
When I See Jesus
 
When I see Jesus, I will know Him by the nail scars in His hands 
When I see Jesus, I will know that I have reached the Promised Land 
I'll see His glory in the eyes
Of every child of God in sight 
When I see Jesus I'll know everything's alright
When I See Jesus
 
Moses sent twelve spies to Canaan land to see what they could see 
There to spy out all the possibilities 
And although ten of them only saw embarrasing defeat 
Caleb and Joshua saw only victory
When I See Jesus
 
When I see Jesus 
I never will look back on this whole world (never looking back) 
When I see Jesus 
Forever I will live in glory above
When I See Jesus
 
A man named Saul was traveling along the Damascus Road one day 
Persecution of God's church was on his mind
Then the Savior struck him blind for his redemption to reveal 
That a better way's remaining to be seen
When I See Jesus
 
Christians, see the church is made of people just like you and me 
For it's sure we're full of fallability
But on that last great day when Jesus comes to set His people free 
A perfect church forever we will be

"Who Knew?
 
[Verse 1:
 
I'm sure that you heard the rumors bout me
Word on the street is I'm that B
But you didn't care nothing bout that
Said I was the one you had to have 
Knowing that I wasn't into no games
Wasn't tryna' take nobody's last name
But you changed my mind 
Took me off the grind 
Now I'm yours for life.
Who Knew?
 
[Pre-Chorus:
 
What if I never met you? 
What would it take to get to 
This thing that you do, 
That can't nobody else do
What if you we're still on the block?
Would this love we got make you stop? 
I don't wanna ever think about it
Can't do without it.
Who Knew?
 
[Chorus:
 
Who Knew? 
It would be you changing my plans, 
Stealing my heart 
Who knew? 
You were the one just like me 
Snatch a sista up and wifed me 
Who knew that you would be my baby daddy? 
Spending all your hard-earned money on me 
You came out the blue, boy I'm glad it's you
Tell me who knew?
Who Knew?
 
[Verse 2:
 
Ain't nobody gonna take me
Cause you're the only one that ever shown me
What it's like to know real love
What it's like to get that good love
Getting turned on and getting turned out 
Getting it so good that there's no doubt
There ain't never gonna be a time
When I'm not his and he ain't mine
Who Knew?
 
[Pre-Chorus

Who Knew?
 
[Chorus

Who Knew?
 
[Bridge:
 
It coulda' been you with some other chick
And it coulda' been me with another man
You could've walked by and none of this would happen
Now we're shopping for baby shoes
Now it's rings, bells, and a preacher too
Now we're forever
Tell me who knew?
Who Knew?
 
[Chorus x2

"Without You
 
[Verse 1:
 
I was a fool for taking it out on you 
There's nothing I wouldn't do to make it up to you
One conversation baby that's all I ask
We can work this thing out it really ain't all that bad
See I was wrong for what I did all those nasty things I said 
I was trying to pay you back for making me so mad 
So if my soul my heart I beat 
Will you help me on my feet 
And I promise you I'll never fall again
Without You
 
[Chorus:
 
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I got nothing to give without you 
Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
I don't wanna love without you
I think I'm giving up without you
I know I can't go another day... without you
Without You
 
[Verse 2:
 
I stay locked in my room I don't go out no more
I keep hoping it's you that's knocking on my door
I'm not sleeping too well I've not had a meal in days
See baby I need your help what is it gonna take 
I would give my soul my breath if you just meet me at end 
So that I can tell you all the things you need to hear 
And I swear to tell the truth cause I never lie to you 
Let's get back to making love like lovers do
Without You
 
[Chorus:
 
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I got nothing to give without you 
Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
I don't wanna cry without you
I think I'm gonna die without you
I know I can't go another day... without you
Without You
 
[Hook:
 
Loneliness is what I'll forever breathe
Only If U decide to rescue me 
Show me the way to get back to your heart 
And I'll travel down that road no matter how far
Where ever you are
Without You
 
[Chorus: x2
 
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I got nothing to give without you 
Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
Without You
 
I don't wanna love without you
I think I'm giving up without you
I know I can't go another day... without you
Without You
 
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
I got nothing to give without you 
Cause I don't wanna breathe without you
Without You
 
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna be without you
