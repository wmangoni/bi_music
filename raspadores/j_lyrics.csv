"10,000 Hours (feat. Dan + Shay)
 
Do you love the rain? 
Does it make you dance 
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song?
Does it make you smile? 
Do you think of me?
10,000 Hours (feat. Dan + Shay)
 
When you close your eyes 
Tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all
10,000 Hours (feat. Dan + Shay)
 
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you
10,000 Hours (feat. Dan + Shay)
 
Do you miss the road that you grew up on? 
Did you get your middle name from your grandma? 
When you think about your forever now 
Do you think of me?
10,000 Hours (feat. Dan + Shay)
 
When you close your eyes 
Tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all
10,000 Hours (feat. Dan + Shay)
 
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
10,000 Hours (feat. Dan + Shay)
 
Ooh, want the good and the bad and everything in between 
Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity 
Ooh, yeah
10,000 Hours (feat. Dan + Shay)
 
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn
That sweet heart of yours (sweet heart of yours) 
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try (yeah)
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you

"2 Much
 
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere
2 Much
 
Maybe I stare too much 
Maybe not long enough 
Funny how I forget to blink 
But when you let down your hair 
Dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm s'posed to be
2 Much
 
Say: Love you, under my breath 
More times than you can digest 
Music every time I hear your name, oh 
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up, but I still ain't got no rest
2 Much
 
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you it's like two months
2 Much
 
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you it's like two months
And that's too much
2 Much
 
Love the way you love your mom 
Take on all your friends problems 
Still, somehow, stop the world for us, oh 
I still relive that second 
I met my biggest blessing 
Prayed for you, look what God has done

"Afraid To Say (feat. Lauren Walters)
 
I'm afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle 
And I'm afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly I wanna hold back
Afraid To Say (feat. Lauren Walters)
 
Do we got the room to make mistakes? 
Are we judged for everything we say? 
I wanna grow but I'm afraid
And will it always be the same?  
Does what I gotta say even matter?  
Is life about climbing up the ladder? 
And can we even see lives that are shattered? 
Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society? 
When everybody's getting canceled
And can't there be room for maturity?
Cause writing em off is not the answer

We can't write people off
God never writes us off 
Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it 
Even when we're doing that stupid thing we wish we weren't doing
God never writes us off, ever 
He's with us in our pain, he's with us in our struggle
He's with us in our bad decisions
He's with us all the time, he never writes us off 
Afraid To Say (feat. Lauren Walters)
 
You formed the whole of me 
Inward and out 
I am awesomely and wonderfully created  
Your creations are spectacular 
You skillfully designed me 
You saw the essence of me, before I was formed 
Before I existed, all of my days were written in Your book

A guitar with only one string 
I could only play one song 
A simple melody 
Simple enough to make the world sing 
Strong enough to make your mood swing 
You know what I mean

If you had a diamond for all of your passion 
Diamond for your dedication 
You could be icy like caking 
Icy for every occasion

See, growing up, I 
Always felt like I had to be the best at everything 
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that 
That I'd get recognition from that, but
I quickly found out that 
I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren't perfect and
By not being perfect, you 
You sometimes can disappoint people, and 
And with God, it's like He's, He's perfect to me
He never disappoints 
So I just get my recognition from Him 
And give Him recognition

This ain't a simulation, it's a blessing
Is it a mistake or is it destined? 
We ain't got no time for second guessin
We can't save ourselves, we need a savior
We ain't make ourselves, we need a maker

I don't need a jail system, I walk in conviction
I'd rather pray to God, than pray for wishes
I'm supernatural, not superstitious, there's a difference
Like relationship versus religion, that's a prison
I'm lightin' circle, then royal purple inside a prism
This flow is so universal, it came with dreams and visions 
I got the keys to the kingdom, I'm bout my father business
I came up straight from the bottom, I started from the finish

We da new stars, that's why they still hatin
Money up front, we never waitin
Save some and invest some 
Just let my money be patient 
It's a cold world we that we live in
Diamonds all in my pendant 
They wish Satan tellers was in it 
Then they'd prey for me to be finished

And they only spare heat cause I'm playing for the Sun
Playing for the king, playing for the title 
I'm suprised you didn't hear this in the bible
I'm so tight I might go phsyco
Christmas time so heres a recital 
I'm so bad like Michael I know
I'm still young but I go I go

At the table with the family 
Having dinner, blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker 
Then I took a look to see before the act 
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter 
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla 
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter 
I said cool, cool 
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off 
See the other family members and drop gifts off 
Then I'm headed to the studio cause aint nothing stopping
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers 
Merry Christmas, quanta, happy hanukkah!

If you wanna get its the time of year 
JB on the beat yeah yeah I'm on the stand
Its crazy how some people say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food its not fair
Its about time for you to act narily 
Its about time for you give to charity 
Barely to people don't wanna help at all
Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls 
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they can hold
So I think some of you need to act bold 
Can we get to a tribe let's change the globe

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, yeah

If you can’t see the top, then you can’t be number one, number one 
Go spread your wings just like an eagle and fly 
oh don’t you look back after you conquer the sky

Never wanna run away, never let your work be in vain 
When you see the finish line is in your face 
Have no pain, no pain 
When love is all you have to give 
You gotta let it persevere through the pain, any pain 
Let your light shine through 
Don’t let none get in your way 
No pain\xa0(no pain), no pain\xa0(oh, no pain) 
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah 
No pain, fearless,\xa0oh no pain 
Oh woah, oh woah, no pain

When I was young I used to sing out on the block 
No one came in your space, I had to make my own spot, aye 
Staying determined, wasn’t easy at times 
Never stopping your focus, till all fell in line
Fearless
 
Never did I run away, never let my work be in vain 
When the finish line was in my face 
Have no pain, no pain 
When love is all you have to give

For this day to come 
Now that it's here let's make it special

There's so many thoughts on my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song
Ain't no chaperons
This could be the night of your dreams

Give the first dance to me

Under the disco ball 
Were the only ones on the floor

That two of us will remember

No teachers around 
To see us dancing close 
I'm telling you
Our parents would never know

Before the lights go up 
And the music turns off 
Now's the perfect time
For me to taste your lip gloss

Your glass slippers 
In my hand, right here 
We'll make it
Before the clock strikes nine

When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (no way) 
What are you willing to do to stay together? ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up fore the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brrr-brrr) 
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (fix it, fix it)

Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place 
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh 
I lied to myself bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down

No, I don’t wanna leave you, I’m no good alone

How they come ando go like cat burglars 
Reality is kind hard to face 
Like actual facts is for flat-earthers 
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one can change
From one what was just hours ago 
Such is life, though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture 
It's exactly the same, it's macro, micro
Crack your atom and let your light glow 
One day you can be the King of Pop and the next one just be wack old Michael 
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

Know it hurts to see the truth in your face 
Circumstances bring you down to your knees 
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it

Oh, don't lose your self esteem
I apologise for being a man 
It's way harder than what it seems

The first time when you said forever i'll be yours
Started walking your hand in my hand feelings got stronger 
We made a promise

And whenever i leave it feels like your still wiht me 
But it all came crashing down 
Sitting in my room i gotta get out of here 
What am i to do when i look up and your not there

She's priceless for real
You don't ever have to do a thing
But give me all your love and affection 
You have something going for yourself 
That's the type of girl for me

Take you on a trip right by my side 
To a special place where we belong 
So many things all on my mind 
Can't wait to get you all alone

Hey girl, you're something out a magazine
You're something off a movie screen
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say 
Hey girl, you're something like a silhouette
What you see is what you get

"I Am Your Man
 
I always see the girls walk past me 
But they really dont know what im like 
Im funny,talented and stupid 
I hate boys because they try to take my women 
They get on my nerves so i start pokin
I Am Your Man
 
So i keep on saying 
I cant stand guys 
They have ugly eyes 
They smell like cats 
And are fats 
They are so stupid 
They act like cupid 
But they dont know,I am your man 
Ha

You know I've been searchin' for someone
I've been lookin  uh, for the perfect one
Who could share that special love with me 
Mrs. Perfect 
And your eyes have that glow 
She had that glow though 
Could it be your face I see on my computer screen 
Could it be? 
Uh, yeah 
Go
Love Thru The Computer (feat. Gucci Mane)
 
I was in the jail thinking bout problems
Like all the niggas, when I get out, I'ma rob em
Shit was hard, up and down, it was 09
Lookin' through this magazine, she was so fine
Pretty brown, black bitch with a draft pick 
High, yellow thick chick with an accent 
I told her: I ain't ever seen another cuter
Good brain, she don't even need a tutor
Fuck the shooter, I'll shoot a nigga, shoot em
Long money, I don't even need a ruler
Big dawg, I ain't even been a poodle
So much ice on my bitch, she need a cooler 
And I just stirred the P's like Luda
But drop it low like you be doin' on that computer
You want a loan, get your love, I want computer love 
So drop it low and back it back like a computer does
Love Thru The Computer (feat. Gucci Mane)
 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, you can meet me, you can meet me on my laptop 
Ooh, when we both logged on, I didn't wanna turn off
That's that computer love
Love Thru The Computer (feat. Gucci Mane)
 
Hit you up on the laptop 
I told you meet me at the last spot, you went with me, fell in love 
Didn't take long for you to gain my trust, no
With all that I've been through, you make it simple
I never thought I would meet an angel 
Until I met you, until I met you
Love Thru The Computer (feat. Gucci Mane)
 
I'ma put you on the rocks
Nobody fuckin' with the Wops
Baby give me all that she got 
Share it with me, we gon' throw it all in the pot
This the type of love more than physical 
When a king get a queen, he invisible 
Fought the system every level, it was critical 
Fuck the feds, state, civil, and municipals 
Even then, through computers I was kissin' you
Remember through the computer, I would visit you 
Daydreamin' bout us fuckin' in your living room
Doin' push ups cause I know you bout to visit soon
I'm from the 6, I grew up in the worst trap
I'm way too rich, babe, to fall for a thirst trap
Plus I know the grass ain't greener on the other side
Cause my house so big, I rarely see the other side

Let's do that on the mattress

I just keep askin': Is it real, is it real?
Look, tell me, is it real? 
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted 
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, wassup? 
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it 
Don't you take my grant it though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin
And to leave this bed I'ma need a fuckin' ransom
Man, I got her screamin\' finally famous! when we fly around 
Never lie to you unless I lie you down 
I put the writin' on the wall
But you don't understand it all like we in chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones 
And when you put the twos together 
That's not twenty-two, it's forever

"MLK Interlude
 
I say to you this morning 
That if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you 
That you will die for it, then you aren't fit to live
You may be 38 years old as I happen to be 
And one day some great opportunity stands before you 
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle 
Some great issue, some great cause 
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid 
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer 
You're afraid that you will lose your job
Or you're afraid that you will bе criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity 
Or you're afraid that somеbody will stab you
Or shoot at you or bomb your house 
And so you refuse to take the stand 
Well you may go on and live until you are 90 
But you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement 
Of an earlier death of the spirit 
You died when you refused to stand up for right 
You died when you refused to stand up for truth 
You died when you refused to stand up for justice

Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept
Purpose
 
I put my all into your hands 
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can 
You're not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift 
That I've ever known
You give me purpose 
Yeah, you've given me purpose
Purpose
 
Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace 
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh, would you please? 
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease
Purpose
 
I put my heart into your hands 
Learn the lessons you teach 
No matter when, wherever I am 
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday 
You give me purpose in every way
Purpose
 
Oh, you are my everything 
Oh, you are my everything
Purpose
 
I don't know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it's wrong
But I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again 
We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given
So you have to understand that these, like, that's not who you are
You know you're trying to be the best you can be
But that's all you can do
If you don't give it all you got
You're only cheating yourself
Give it all you got 
But if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
Purpose
 
That's what it's
That's what's happening with me
It's like, God, I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it
And it's like I'm not giving myself grace
I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is

It feel like a Tuesday when you met me 
I remember it like it was yesterday 
You just said hello, I lost my sanity 
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality 
When you said goodbye, that was a tragedy 
Had to get a lesson in anatomy 
You just ran me over 
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense 
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense 
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance 
Everything was in divine sequence

Set a place at the table for someone who might need it

Gotta change my answering machine 
Now that I'm alone
Cuz right now it says that we 
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense 
Cause you walked out the door 
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just

And I'm stronger than this

No more walkin round 
With my head down 
I'm so over being blue
Cryin over you

So tired of tears 
So done with wishing you were still here 
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calender I have 
That's marked july 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory 
And how every song reminds me 
Of what used to be

So tired of tears 
So done with wishing you were still here 
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow

Leave me alone

Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child 
Let it go

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness? 
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed 
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots 
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us 
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain? 
I need a place to rest my head 
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead 
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it 
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him 
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion
Thugz Mansion
 
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook 
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke 
Then some lady named Billie Holiday 
Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band 
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past 
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last 
Picture a place that they exist, together 
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven 
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

Preparing for another day 
A kiss upon my cheek 
He's here reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

Because we both know 
Where I'm about to go

And it kills him inside

Maybe it's because the lies, they fill her up
You see the ghost on her front porch

Thankful that we worked it out, we come so far (come so far)

It's never too late to start

I says: Whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer 
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me 
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place 
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42

Guess I knew it was the only thing stable 
When I was young, I could pick things up quick 
Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it

Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker 
Thought I knew everything in life, yeah 
That caught up to me later 
I had to learn about humility 
I had to grow up and accept responsibility, yeah

That wasn't easy, cause at 17, I had a milli

But deep inside I felt deprivеd just like an empty can

I was livin' in a mansion doin' big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin' dicey
I was doin' stupid shit to get people to like me
We're In This Together
 
All that to say, I'm thankful that's not who I am
And I'm thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
Cause He's the reason that I'm still standin
And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin
Plannin' peace, plannin' joy, plan another day
Gave His life upon the cross to wash his sins away
We're In This Together

Listening to this song right now 
I pray for peace, I pray for joy 
I pray for confidence, I pray for reassurance
We're In This Together
 
I thank You so much for the person 
Listening to this right now 
I pray that you would bless them 
Bless their mind, bless their finances 
Bless their family, bless their sons, bless their daughters 
Bless their moms, bless their dads, bless their grandparents 
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence 
In their home right now
We're In This Together
 
An overwhelming sense of Your peace 
That says everything is going to be all right 
In the name of Jesus

I'm all world star
All them other blogs 
All them haters hatin' cause I am a heart throb
But do I want it all? 
All the negativity is not gonna get rid of me 
I'm here to make history
I'm speakin' it real
Back track to the days when I ain't have me a deal, yeah
So I'ma show the world that I'm ill
Every beat that I get on best believe I'ma kill
So you can have all the jewelry 
Have all the cars 
Have all the fame 
Have all the broads 
You can have the fact that I'm a star
Just so you can listen to these bars

Walk the path of destiny. 
Definitely been neglected, but god is always testin' me.
Rest in peace to all the men that died that were protecting me. Objectively, I need to tell you what just gets the best of me. 
Essentially, people in this world just wanna 
let it be. 
A lot of men ain't different though, just let it be.
Set it free. 
Never be scared to make change, effectively. 
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively. 
Every person in this world can do good. 
I just want this message understood.
