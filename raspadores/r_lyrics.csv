"4 Sho Sho
 
[Intro/Outro: Forest Whitaker
 
The way of the samurai is found in death 
Meditation of inevitable death should be performed daily 
Every day, when one's body and mind are at peace
He should meditate up on being up to blocked 
by arrows, rifles, spears and swords 
Being carried away by surging waves 
Being thrown in to the midst of a great fire 
Being struck by a lightning, and shaken to death by a great earthquake 
Falling from thousand foot cliffs, dying of a disease 
Commiting seppiku at the death of one's master
In everyday when one fails, one should consider himself as dead 
This is a substance of the way of a samurai
4 Sho Sho
 
[Christ Bearer
 
Nigga I don't wanna talk
I own one, ghost gun, briefcase in this equilibrium 
It's the killa on your block, melodic flux
War flock, of perfected, dead it, bloods chop it up 
And the birds of a feather, fly together 
Intellaced moving mo' murder messages of me and Leatha Face
I'm your retainer, your perfect stranger
36th Chamber, Wu-Tang banga 
I hit the dust and bust a straight no braina 
Heavyweight gaina, and a lone blown ranger 
Welcome to the world I rock 
Doing what in the cut, while niggas know not 
Grand theft, awaited with baited breath 
Hear witnesses fear just as clear as death 
In the twinklin of an eye, in the ways of the samurai 
It's do or die, for the devil's pie
Now I'm phat broad down, received from mo' high
So beautiful it make you wanna cry, cry, cry 
Power Equality, Ghost Dog 
For Christ Bearer, Killa Bees, west coast God

[Minky, (RZA)
 
Ah, designed to cause disaster, the mic blaster 
Cause atoms to transfer, with immediate report for you bastards 
I make minds stagger, with this North Star golden dagger 
I self Lord and master, represented in this chapter 
For you phony wild actors, I crack ya 
for tryin to distract us, in the west 
transportin flows of energy in your chest 
Over deep bass tones, in the flesh 
Odd bones are rock clones 
Repentance in the devil home cause he divided the whole globe
Transform souls, told lies, we wrote scrolls 
Now it's on, it's bid war
360 degrees that form the negative swarm 
Born mentally and physically from the essence 
Where North Star be flexin, questin, addressing 
All minds that's hectic, no place to be

"A Day To God Is 1000 Years
 
I wanna stay with you, forever
A Day To God Is 1000 Years
 
[RZA
 
Yo, yo, the A-1 sauce, the Divine Force 
My mind blind force is known to blow time off course 
Even, if I rode around the world on a blind horse 
Strapped down, I'd still get my point across
Allah is father of all 
You debate whether big, whether small 
Whether short, whether tall 
Whether dense, whether length 
Whether strength, whether width 
Either man, animal, bird or fish 
Whether, black or white, more shapes than snowflakes 
Existin  everywhere but you still can't locate
The man of steel couldn't bend me
Time couldn't end me
Even the great devil Satan that tried to befriend me 
Understand the equality, God in a bodily 
Form, lettin' my knowledge be born
Lettin' my knowledge be born...
A Day To God Is 1000 Years
 
I wanna stay with you, forever
A Day To God Is 1000 Years
 
[RZA
 
Yo, yo, yo 
I be the fatal flyin  I'm like NATO flyin
Over your country and droppin' down forty tons of iron
Filled with explosives, your chance is hopeless 
We have your head poppin' up like the blowfish
I'm not talkin' Hootie, nigga pass the zootie
I could bag the cootie, maybe smoke the ootie 
The runaway train with no track 
I got the heart of Faye Dunaway whippin' that child with the coatrack
T.V. droppin' bombs or droppin' germs
Baby moms in the courthouse, she's droppin' terms
Guns go off, bustin' all directions
D.J. choose, another fuckin' dope selection
A Day To God Is 1000 Years
 
...with you forever... 
Like the corners of my mind.... 
I wanna stay with you, forever
A Day To God Is 1000 Years
 
[RZA
 
Yo, the pen is mightier than the sword, as I face my worldly challenge 
In the scale of justice and my heart remains balanced and neutral 
My respect for all men is mutual 
As my thoughts surpass a level to which you devils compute to 
You've been given the chance to hear the true and living
So do the knowledge, son, before you do the wisdom 
So you can understand, how the thunder and 
Lighting above your head is caused by the Son of Man 
We experimentin' with high explosions
That cause the place to quake and the surface erosions 
The earth produce lava like the mouth produce saliva 
This wisdom goes deeper than your scuba diver 
In search for the pearl jewels sold to Tiffany 
My verbal heart symphony will strike the epiphany 
Insight, ignite, and then men might, see love and hell 
Hell and right, then excel, to be masters of your circumference 
First, by obtainin' mastery of your common sense
This supreme wisdom clears a man's vision
You can see it through the lies and the fantism 
Of the equivocal, two-faced political individual 
Who's only out for residual, fabricatin' lies
To eradicate the wise 
But we come to civilize and gravitate to the skies 
Of the heavenly celestial sphere 
Trust me, son, it's dear, in between your ears
A Day To God Is 1000 Years
 
[Chorus 2X: RZA
 
A day to God is a thousand years 
Men walk around with a thousand fears 
The true joy of love bring a thousand tears 
In the world of desire, there's a thousand snares
A Day To God Is 1000 Years
 
I wanna stay with you forever [2X

Yeah it's Bobby Digital
Just floatin over +The City+ 
I came across this, this, this black man 
He was talkin about (look down below)
Be A Man
 
Sure of yourself risin, prices of food skyrisin 
Foreign countries movin in USA, enterprisin 
Snatchin your mic then speakin, while you might be leakin 
Then losin the luxury, average man be seekin 
Thought he was so smart; hoe's cheatin, life fall apart
F**kin a hundred bitches couldn't mend a broken heart
Start as a soda jerk job, as a mail clerk 
F**ked this white bitch in the office, got fired from work 
Nine-to-five, government high taxes, police dispatches 
Beauracatic attackin black Asiatics, resident with bad plumbin 
Cocaine got my brain numb an' bitch complained bout cummin
Pussy stay hummin; $200 parkin, summer's out of state warrants
Be A Man
 
High blood pressure pills prescribed by Dr. Lawrence 
Got me gainin weight, f**kin up my right kidney 
Cousin raped at school Allah wit me
Be A Man
 
Peoples' eyes closed like envelopes by folk membership
With unpaid doctor bills 
Framed got shot and killed, cops poppin pills
Be A Man
 
Three pair cotton, steel closet, cabinet of +No Frills+ 
Mo' bills, sister got evicted from Park Hill
Be A Man
 
Punch a hole inside the NARC wheels 
My dogs bark, still carry dark steel 
And unmarked bills, I'm from the uncut, dope, found on director's reels
Bobby Digital may switch back to Bobby Steels 
Rusty .38's, bought rust inside the herb gate
Be A Man
 
So +Hungry+, son, bout to shrink down to a bird's weight
Rash break out, where's the blue ointment, face-to-face appointments
Un-proudly in the church paid for annointment
Be A Man
 
Bet the checks don't come late
About to separate with her man
Be A Man
 
In +The City+, +Domestic Violence+ excavates 
Get a highest ratio in five years 
The idea is to plant fear 
Boy you slap yo' bitch, po-lice is there to cuff you or snuff you
They might bust you
Be A Man
 
Cause your hoe snatched your money up, didn't want to f**k you
Be A Man
 
We must learn to communicate, and unificate 
Stop the black on black, hate on hate 
White on white, black on white 
Put the love in love 
I'm blunted up, blasted inside the strip club
Shorty wop, fifteen year old, all she needed was love 
And mo' dough so she won't have to show her knotty afro
Collect call from my son to now, he might blow trial 
Foul cut, and cop out to a 3 to 6 
Bad situations, bein a man is hard shit 
Somethin'll get trapped out, I mean, yo
Got crack fiends in spots with vaccine shots 
Black teens drop out of high school, white teens sellin stock
Be A Man
 
with bonds they can't put their word on
20 years, shorty wop, pussy bout to swerve on
Up in the crib, new fridge, dead pig 
Two kids, pawned this older cat who looked like Calvin Coolridge 
But got splat in his back last year 
Robbin' his jewel inside the diamond district
No one got convicted, heard they never found the biscuit 
I'm booby trapped by the capitalists
Tryin to subsist, sometimes happiness is hot grits and catfish 
Or a bowl of Cookie Crisp, I got harassed by this rookie bitch 
Talkin' bout I couldn't put my feet on the fire hydrants
to tie my kicks, $50 ticket, bout to strike and picket
and shout at the City Hall, motherf**k the wicked 
Too greedy, give to the needy, down on my luck 
bout to jab a ouija board, that's when Bobby Digi seen me
Be A Man
 
Said, Yo son, don\'t stress out over no one, learn the slogan: 
Knowledge is half the battle, that's one to grow on
And don't be counterfeit
It\'s a bad situation which bein a man, but we got to handle it 
Bad situation when you ain't bein a man

With sword style so retarded, it leave enemies 
Dearly departed, and we nearly cold hearted 
But, down for the fam, mad rivers of blood 
It started pouring on land, this be a warrior's clan
Without a friend in the world, they find you in the end 
But I'm loving my girl, cause she fight for the win
Will sport a sinister grin, when blowing smoke in the wind 
Committing menacing sins, all in the name of the kin 
With pinpoint precision and a fro's that's wild
Cold razor sharp style again, we killing them down 
Stay defending on ten, never depending on men 
Living the samurai code from a hundred on in

And be the last man standing after the last blow

And swarm like the Wu, when the planet come blitz you 
A wise samurai who's aliby is this high
Humble as a butterfly, but a killer inside 
Strong family ties, will keep equality prize 
Solidy rise, to each other, honestly we can fight 
In tune on the attack, platoon up in the back 
With room, taking no slack, we zoom in the format 
Typhoons, kabooms, and full moons when we combat 
Killas for contract, with ninjas and all that 
And if you ain't family, we barely gon' interact
Love is for kin folk, a bond is a killer's pack
We strike too quickly for the enemies to react 
Blood thick as mud, and a heart is a road map

Can't think about the proper remedies for destroyin' us
Your best bet black is sit back N' start enjoyin' us
N' run your commissary, attack your coronary

Get boosted from the sorrow N' went Wu-tonic
You be fickle, get your tongue thrown into a jar of pickle 
To serve to your bird with cheese N' pumpernickle

Fresh spring water from the ounce 
Stalked like a tomahawk, Indian bitch, you get scalped 
Like a ticket sold in Cleveland, you feel me in

Ay, yo, let me tell y'all niggaz somethin
One thing, let me tell y'all niggaz somethin
I don't give a flyin fuck about
None of y'all niggaz out here
None of y'all niggaz out here
Cause you ain't none of my motherfucker comrades
I don't give a flyin fuck what?
You want it? Bring it son bring it son 
Bring it, yo, check it on out

Yo, lyrically, I got all y'all niggaz under my wing
Cause I bring terror throughout this rap era 
Like them Muslim cats, who don't give a fuck
Bobby Did It
 
About blowin this rock, off the map 
Where mayor Giuliani rest at, so let me get that 
Microphone up off of you, cause it's
Definitely not meant for you to have it in your palm 
To try to rock the crowd 
Puttin it all on to stay calm 
You waited for the God Islord to drop the bomb 
And swarm the stage about a hundred fat 
With lyrical material, that's all that
Like a two point five carat clustered jewel 
Rock like Patti la-belle 
Cause everything is real kid, you dead up 
Dissect the true kids gettin set up 
For a car/jeep heist, it ain't nice
As we ran up in the crib and stuck the kid 
And smacked the wife, cause she had on two chains 
With a tray full of ice in em 
But that's how it goes down
When you livin in the cold world
Bobby Did It
 
Cold world, what? 
Yo, I spit flames thermonuclear type 
Ignite mics, blow up you S.A. satellites 
Insane Unabomber, my whole fam lace golden armor 
Royal calmer, black queen black Madonna 
The missing link be the big lips on the sphinx 
Intelligent instincts 
I say knowledge is the foundation 
When I move in the l's formation, against hell's nation
Bobby digital cybertech test microcheck 
High bi-as, record the levels 
Anti for devils anti for devils

Eventually says 
I wanna be digital bobby 
Bobby digital, Rza? Bobby, bobby digital
Bobby Did It
 
All you analog cats from weak tracks, and weak raps 
And weak video clips and weak stacks 
Beatin bitches with weak lawyers, and weak acts 
And weak staffs, born life couldn't copyright
With weak math, come get a dose, of the strong 
Coconuts splittin, all you chocolate deluxe butter alms 
French buttercups, probably wanna see bobby in handcuffs 
With the toes in my mouth 
Stand up or rape me, rotate auto-locate me 
In the center solar 
Corner block hip-hop now expand to the polar 
Fuzzy low short frequency 
Circuit breakers, try to take 
Us on illusionary rides to the future 
Polygram graphic rap actors, flash ya 
Cash and jewelry like bus passes 
That's why your ass got stuck up
So wake the fuck-up or get smoked 
Analog rhymes hoes are like groupies we fucking 
Took for derelict, sales are too soupy 
Better get the bobby digital movie!

Tarantula, that groove season 
Newlywed of rap, which g you believe in? 
Rally back, twist a half a man arm off 
Late night, nearly happy standoff 
How boldly blinded by bobby crossthievin van diva 
Lever 2000 mic talk 
Might bolt to match, pinch me in the eve 
Carved perfectly from God 
Manufactured through the eye, came puma dash 
I snare Dumar, Nicolas, half a face, cage 
Half a coke dutch sprinkle sage 
Bounce to Huey crib yo and got laid 
Straight off the ground y'all word up

Yo, my nigga dix'll leave you whiplashed, feel the cash

Hard to walk the righteous path 
Flavor for life into death

I'm at Radio 1 just doin' my thing tonight
And just walked into this studio some of the hottest UK cats out there
Boing, Boing
 
My man Skinnyman {Woah, woah, Blade <what's up?>
And Mr. Tibbs what's the deal? What you got for me?
{Yeah we got ya the new banger Tim straight from RZA 
Straight from the Wu-Tang 
<Yeah this is Blade and the track, the hot new joints called the Boing, Boing>

Down it's gonna bang in ya face, lets go

Regardless, I'll be here bringin' it heartless
Ruthless, to the death I'll stand for the truth yes
My God given talent is all that I can do best 
Keep spittin' over these tracks and leavin' you blessed
So who requested my time on the set 
Skinnyman's what you get, so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet
Ya best upthreat cause it gets better yet
I'm that deft intellect, them boy they don't pent
Boing, Boing
 
So who requested Wu-Tang on the set (it's the RZA)
What you get so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet
We'll never let anybody else step
Or ever come with anything less for what you'd expect
If you pass me the mic then I'll gladly accept
I'll take it to the street, show you how rough it can get
cause everybody knows this rappin' thing isn't happenin
Now they jack it in and go back to shottin' crack again
Locked down the block and get strapped with the gat again 
Then we break it down then just deal with the matter then 
So how you'd think a British ghetto youth feels
He can't get a record deal but he can get drugs to deal
He can't get a job but he can go for rob and steel
Lookin\' for a mill\' while you screamin\' keep it real! 
So I'll just stand here with this mic that I hold
Request the higher force to sweep over my soul 
So I can fulfill my dream, go for my goals 
I'm sick of spendin' every late night out of role
Boing, Boing

Calm but still merciless, rugged on impact 
Explosive, leavin' nuttin' but rubber with a spinback
Snap a photo with your camera, capture the stamina
Boing, Boing
 
Hand it to a amature, show him how to damage a 
Live set, make him feel the full effect
Boing, Boing
 
And yet still make it hard to detect and what's left?
Four men remain standin' like Gladiators
When the dusk clears nuttin' for the average ears
For years its been the same with minds of the artillery 
God forgave us all for the merciless delivery 
Holdin' the tools of the trade with a death grip
Rememberin' the times when nothin' was right, we was desperate
Dreams blown to smithereens, turned into nightmares with screams 
There's a world of CREAM
If all goes correct we can stash supreme
Boing, Boing
 
Feed the fiend cause that's the way it was meant to have been
You should of seen the comin  the language is universal
Boing, Boing
 
One time perfect attack with no rehearsal 
Shook the Earth for what it's worth
You're in danger of a takeover, and it's analysed as global
We can find them whatever your predictions 
Enterin' the realm unknown with no restricitons
It might be hard to believe 
We invade, we conquer and lead

[Mr. Tibbs
 
I'm a country man at heart but a city man by nature
cause even though it's f**k free, it's all about the paper
I love to live expensive, smoke like I'm in Jamiaca
Even when I'm broke I think I'm like but a creater
Avoids the green, even from my early teens 
???????? in need of CREAM seen (seen)
Boing, Boing
 
But then I had a dream bout bein' the best rapper
But that ain't what it seems, next chapter
That's spreadin' the word
Inspiration from the hurb is what you hear when I got heard 
I sat back and observed most of the men that shined before me 
All that respect, keeper know nough of them will bore me
Singin' the same story, I'm better than you
And to tell you the truth most of them men are shut fools 
We asked them in the struggle to make ends meet 
That's why I told these MCs that talk is cheap
You might think you know Tibbs, you don't know me
Unless you walk my streets and talk to my peeps
Boing, Boing

Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing 
Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing

With your high pitched face like eye liner 
If the black gat bust you get struck by the side winder 
You can't block and stop it when I spotted
I shoot like Luke Skywalker inside the cockpit 
Aimin' at the top fighter
Boing, Boing
 
Who I mighta have thirty thousand kids spark the lighter
Boing, Boing
 
And set flames to the sky, we aim high 
The baseline kick like the kid from Shang-Hi 
Make your bubble bust, cuddle up from the rubble thrust 
You'se will have the double juice duck, then I doubled up
To the double four, puddles pour from ya bum bot 
Open swords can't be cured by the blood clot
Ya bum bastards, son I come classic 
Frame won't last the length of my matchstick
Boing, Boing
 
Drunk off the Hennessey V.S. stop the B.S. 
I'm still off to catch the CREAM like P.S.
Jake was makin' that green
People always say what the hell does that mean

Whether busting shots, throwing blocks, swinging swords, throwing hands 
They can end to the end, not near friends

Although life is daily right, makes us sometimes appear weaker 
I'm still there for you brother, I'm my brother's keeper

of lies and delusions to myself I have lied 
burning inside and wanting to open wide

I'm lusting for girls
before I imagined a genie and a wish 
and I'm searching for things that does not exist
but in my midst there's the answer
for which i have searched 
causefrom me springs the divine prince rakheem 
and that is me the master of equality 
give myself the opportunity 
and set free and be all I can be

Four shellies rip through his belly 
Blast him right outside of Mike's deli
Dip to the tele 
Call my bird up on the celle 
Bobby what Bobby lust I walk strange 
And talk strange 
Long range sniper aims 
Swiss cheese your brain 
I don't sleep
And don't eat meat
Rest twice a week 
Speak without moving my lips 
Got fifty pairs of sneaks 
Fingerprint proof rubber grips 
Hollow tip clips 
Eight ounce sip bud nips 
We crack private do chips 
And clock a bird off the block 
Straight away from a flock 
Just caught me at the bus stop 
Twist the Snapple top 
Off, pierced her breast 
Kept her hair processed 
No panties underneath the dress 
Wally ankle bracelet 
Polo frames 
Her shades had no name 
Popocane 
I slowed my game 
Thick gold chains 
Make your eyes flame 
Up against the Bodega gate 
She stay straight 
Perfect figure eight 
Shape, couldn't wait
To bust her grape 
With the applehead 
Legs spread open 
Invincible body armor 
My scarlet blade will slice the leg 
From the Shaolin llama

[Chorus: sample
 
I come for darkness, and lightness will appear 
And you got to disappear, through this chamber of fear
Chamber Of Fear
 
[Rev. William Burke
 
Yo, aiyo, the 36 Chambers of vigorous training 
Pinpoint aiming, arrigorous paining 
Swordplay, villanous blood staining 
Meditation, grace and mind elevation 
To trigger the thought, the law of the court 
Be the love of the sport, and it can't be bought
Once taught, the hidden Chi secret style art 
To use it, to get to the top and not part 
I sought, a means of escape from the darkness 
And how much energy will victory cost us 
12 Jewelz, and the Gods move cautious 
Twelve fools, had attempted to flaw with us 
But we pop shots at em, like jump shots
Three hundred and sixty degrees, cause we lunch box 
With more kung fu chops than Ong Bak 
One drop, of Wu blood'll make it hot to the last drop
Chamber Of Fear
 
[RZA
 
I suppose you know, you can't oppose the chosen one
My cold mental chill will leave Phoenix with a frozen 
sun 
Gravities being shot from a golden gun 
No defending my lane, boy, no holding, son 
Just submit, my crown is undefeatable 
So bow down to the dragon, that's unbeatable
Programming my thoughts, that's undeletable
You'll imagine me achieving the inconcivable
Shake opponents, the God is unbreakable 
Try to steal the moment, but you dogs are incapable 
Trials and tribulations, and fouled the stipulation 
My word articulation, will uplift the nation 
You can bet, I'm a triple threat
Whether assisting, defending or swishing through the 
net 
Dot world wide web, I'm a world wide celeb
Bobby got Bush like George and Jeb 
King pioneer, travel with the Cavaliers 
Step inside the square, if you dare wanna battle here

Preach prophet, drop God body logic 
Whose squadron invincible, and devils can't stop it
We cosmic comets from the lands of the tropics 
Who see through third eye optics, like cockpits

Against all odds, and against all squads 
We defending the yard, with the strength of the God 
And stand and deliver, face the man in the mirror 
And abandon our fears, without a blam or a shiver 
If I give my word, then I plan to deliver 
Expand my whole Clan, over land and the rivers 
You'll receive from the giver, understand and consider
Don't fall to the fear, you should stand as a pillar

Has ever escaped the torment of it's infinite burden

Yo here we go yo 
The Prince Rakeem, this here is called my deadly venom 
You know what I'm sayin?
Some old freestyle type of slick slang 
For you and your gang 
Girls so ya'll can kinda sweat this
Check it out and ya' don't quit
Deadly Venoms
 
Verse 1: 
And many brothers know me for what? 
My bag of bitches 
But I'm also known for giving stitches
A buck 50 for those who get nifty 
That's why your ass so fast to call me swifty
And here I go and here I go 
Hey yo go out like Bo and act like ya' know
That ya' can't beat me or bring me
The least bit of harm 
Sssss, um um, uh uh 
Heck no, I keep a sucker brain petrified 
When I grab the mic I won't let go, I'd
Rather go live forever and ever and ever 
Let it go? Never 
Assume a lot of boys are doomed 
Without being tuned 
To many many many moons 
As the champ that blast through your amp 
I can't get weak cause my style can't cramp
I'm rugged like Guess black denim
Battles ya'll know I always ran em
When it comes to rappers, they're seeds
I'll plant em
As I eject ya' wit' a dose of deadly venom
This is the way I like to parle 
And amputate to the words I say 
The tormentor, take you on a mad adventure 
Through an episode that's cold like the winter
Check your checklist 
And see if you can wreck this 
You thought I was a lover 
And didn't expect this
Style I specify but now you can testify 
Thee not a less the best is I
Deadly Venoms
 
Deadly Venoms 
Deadly Venoms kid 
Check it out yo
Deadly Venoms
 
Verse 2: 
No time for charades or masquerades 
It's more rugged shit with the kid with braids
And I like brothers to step up and show what they got 
And watch em drop on the spot
And pop the corns 
Just raw like crumbs from my tongue 
Cause you're small like Tom Thumb
But I'm great, up to date and elevate
Rhymes I design 
I write with paper mate 
I stimulate your thoughts 
Can't take shorts
Won every battle that I ever fought 
So friend or foe 
Who want to go toe to toe? 
Yo you know you're gonna fall below
Zero don't try to play hero
Like um, Robert DeNiro and Crazy Shapiro 
But I exempt not to be a wimp 
I walk with a limp of a Roscoe pimp 
I'm a slickster
Who's out to get your sister
You disagree with me? F**k you mister 
So uncanny brothers can't stand me
I'll take the panties from your mammy and your granny
Rap crusader, bam boom invader 
Sex capader and also a panty raider 
So protect your property 
Cause when it comes to baggin' girls
No one is stopping me 
Or getting rid of me 
I'm the epitome
Even cold f**k the statue of liberty 
That's the way that I am though
Yea Rakeem wit' a rugged deadly venom (venom)
Deadly Venoms
 
Yea check it the deadly venom (venom) 
Word, the deadly venom kid 
Yea a deadly venom (venom)
Deadly Venoms
 
Verse 3: 
Suckers step to me and think they can do me 
Your style is screwy like Hong Kong Fuey 
You can't push me, rush or mush me
Dust or crush, or even ambush me 
Cause I'll play ya' right out of position
See through your mission with x-ray vision 
And once I see ya' I get Scrooge like Ebenezer
Crush ya' like black Caesar
After that I'll leave ya
Hit em wit' a symptom of Rakeem fever
You get strung, hung, swung 
Done, by a witty rap tongue 
>From a young man who understood 
What it takes to be good 
Make a rhyme sound like it should 
Susa I'm makin' this style looser
I turn men to stone like Medusa 
You get blown and thrown off course 
Feel the remorse 
You're forced to take a loss
I get crazier 
Slay ya' like Hell Raiser
Style amaze ya' I'm rugged like a trail blazer
Then I crash right through your 
Lyrics I sued em
They're moving like U-Haul
Booming em, doing em, wrap em
Like aluminum fo-o-oil 
Your plans got spoiled 
Rhymes will affect ya
Who loves to wreck ya'?
I laugh in your face like I'm Woody Woodpecker
(mocks Woody Woodpecker's laugh)
You can't get with the Ra
Deadly venom
Deadly Venoms
 
Word, Know what I'm sayin?
The Prince Rakeem strikes again 
Never hit below the belt although the blow is felt

And the gladiator posse 
And the whole Staten Island posse 
And the funky president Mel Kwan

To drive in the wind, surf on the seas

A mother exists, and I see

How can this be? 
You were ser free from your worries 
Now you are gone in the breeze 
Gone in the trees

Day to smile and laugh 
In the wind, how cant it end? 
I'm grateful to meet you, may we meet again

On that highway where heaven begins 
I lost a friend but destiny 
Bends, bends but destiny bends 
Yea, it bends 
I lost a friend, friend

On that highway to heaven 
You will drive in the wind 
And surf in the seas 
Oh how can this be?

Now you are gone in the breeze 
Gone in the trees

Yea, I wanna dedicate this song to my friend Paul Walker 
Up in the studio last night 
Writing for myself 
I decided to write a song for you 
Peace brother
Destiny Bends (feat. Will Wells )
 
Every time I think about you all I see is your smile 
And your bright blue eyes 
Thanks for the time and the smiles 
You shared with me 
How you equally respected my art and talked to me 
A young father just learning what it takes to be… a man 
Sharing time with your daughter, you had a plan 
To drive in the wind, surf on the seas 
Realizing the love for a woman who becomes 
A mother exists… and I see 
How can this be? You were set free from your worries 
Now you are gone in the breeze 
Gone in the trees 
I thought we had another day to smile and laugh 
In the wind, how can it end? 
I’m grateful to meet you, may we meet again 
Paul, my friend
Destiny Bends (feat. Will Wells )
 
On that highway 
Where heaven 
Begins 
I lost a friend 
But destiny 
Bends, bends 
But destiny bends 
Yea, it bends 
I lost a friend 
Friend 
On that highway to heaven
Destiny Bends (feat. Will Wells )
 
You will drive in the wind 
And you’ll surf in the seas 
Oh how can this be? 
You were set free from your worries 
Now you are gone in the breeze 
Gone in the trees 
Your soul is set free

In the wind, how can it end?

Man up in the art gall  my girl, my newborn child

Pulled by the scrolls, read the Book of Obadiah  
Smack ya head against the wall like a Spalding  
My thugs, they carry more drugs than Walgreen's 
Mr. Digital, bodododo, sometimes appear invisible

Get the f**k out my house 
Fore I grab you by your hair and slap dick to your mouth
Bob Digi, yeah you know who is he 
Girl, I f**king slave trade your ass like Kizzy Kinte 
(But wait, f**k you motherf**ker) 
You wish you could f**k 
Bitch, all you can do is dick suck 
(Your ass can't f**k, that's why your wife left your monkey ass)
F**k that, you don't cook, you don't clean, or press my jeans
You don't scrub or wash clothes
Or buy food for making (???), bitch 
You don't read to the seeds
All you do is watch tv and smoke weed 
Get your nails done and feet, scrub the hairweave 
Sleep all day, eat, gain weight, can't breathe
Talking about you're going to leave?
Then bitch leave! What the f**k you're waiting for?
Hit the door, I ain't taking this shit no more!
Spending all my cream on Gucci, Phillies and Coach 
Before you moved to my lab, bitch, I ain't never seen a roach
Stains on my carpet, bathroom's more like a fish market
Take all the space in my closet, where the f**k's your logic?
Disrespecting my old earth, aborted my child birth 
And every day I catch my credit card inside your purse 
You can't speak a sentence without a curse
Talking bout you're going to be a nurse
Bitch, to be a nurse you got to go to shool first! 
When I first met you, you was a hoe 
I tried to reform you, bomb you, warn you and teach you 
But couldn't reach you, and you're still a hoe
Your father said you was a hoe 
And when you leave me, bitch you're gonna be a hoe
Celluloid and gargoyle feet, I'd rather beat my meat
That raggy ass pussy a starving dog wouldn't eat
Started with the body of a model 
Pussy tight as a pharmaceutical bottle 
And you could swallow a whole avocado 
And two forty ounce bottles 
To the end of the world, which to I would follow 
Now, when I f**k you, the shit echos cause you pussy is so hollow
Turn your fat ass sideways 
Your stressmarks are like the US highways 
F**k a new nigga every friday 
Talking bout bust a nut, bitch I'll bust yo guts!
(You come so quick nigga) 
Wonder why I come so quick? 
With that wide ass pussy and soggy tits? 
I'm trying to get the shit over with, and go to sleep!
But when I'm with my real freak on the weekend
Bet that baby we f**k for two and a half hours or three 
You'd better study the 1-0-40 knowledge culture degree
About M-G-T, and G-C-C'Cause you ain't shit, and your mother ain't shit
And your sister ain't shit, and your pussy ain't shit

Yo fucking up the microphone be my hobby 
All you crab motherfuckers out who want to rob me 
You best to slob the knob G 
You could never catch the great Bobby, indestructible 
High producer production 
Suck to the wall like suction cups 
Yea what the fuck is up you duck 
You better slip 
Or get your wrist slit 
Ultimate legit, can't quit when it comes to making hits
A phat ass track I quickly program it 
For others could see me, its like Smothers brothers 
You get spread on bread like the butter 
Peanut, what, see what, B what, razor blade cut from 
your neck to your gut 
Have no shackle 
Easy for me to tackle 
Best to watch back cause my razor sharp style
grapples MC's
With the eagle claw clutch 
I'm just to much to touch
Keep the mike beside me like Starks and Hutch 
Word Up quick to roll a dutch and puff it up 
Blunts everyday in the month 
No need to front 
We cause the blood to gush 
Operation push, it's the Wu!
You scarecrow, jump off the road 
You best to reload, your gat black 
And get your whole shit back phat 
Don't step to me with that
We can't have that weak that
Bob Digital inside your citadel 
Shit is critical, word it's gonna take a miracle
For MC's fall to the fallacy
Here's my rhyme policy
Acknowledge me 
I keep the high quantity plus quality 
Equal make you see the sequel 
Defiant eagles can't match me or royal regal
Lethal eagle techniques 
Word up when I speak the dialect 
It makes girls' pussys get wet
While niggas hit the rewind on my casette 
We could make a thousand dollar bet 
Bobby never failed yet 
Bout to strike gold 
Got Big Free on the ones and two 
Break it down for them one time
Do You Hear The Bells?

Served well keep the phat clientele 
I watch you crab niggas fail 
Try to sail the boat but couldn't stay afloat
I float on a note like a Staten Island ferry boat 
Keep my rhyme chocolate coat 
Bitch you know when you bite my shit it taste sweet 
going down your throat 
Point em out let me sort em out
The fattest links we sport em out
Nuts bubbling boosted from extra scouts from Dublin 
I could fuck a dozen birds and watch a dozen hatch 
I bake my cake from scratch 
Keep the cream inside the middle 
Make you dribble 
That's when I scribble on the paper
To write this script I had to cut down forty acres of trees 
Process the wood to make the notebook sheets 
Blinded from the steel spiral imported from Ohio 
Delivered like the spin whirlwind kick Morio 
Bitch you best to read my bio 
First chapter the back breaker chiropractor technique 
Word up dislocate your shoulder blade joint 
We striking every pressure point 
The high priest solid gold diamond fang teeth 
With the high tech brief around your neck 
I still breach your skin girlfriend 
Let me enter your zone 
Microphones get cast like stone 
Niggas can't never bone how I bone
Word you soft as a shell 
You ain't worth one skin cell
Big broiler crack your back and your head like an eggshell 
And Bobby will scramble you 
Bitch you want to make a bet all right we'll gamble too
Quick to roll see low 
Catch the loop like Niko 
Duck watch out for Roscoe Pico train 
See Sirus with the great dame 
Tryin to infiltrate the game 
Wu-Tang Clan, Wu-Tang Clan 
Special brand name slang 
From the book of the Ichang 
The world changed once Bobby came 
You better go and check your storage 
Wait a minute Goldilocks who the fucks been eating my porridge? 
Somebody been sitting in my chair 
Someone been sleeping in my bed 
It ain't Goldilocks!
Slope down the ice with bobsleds 
Bobby smoke til his eyes get red
Word up you best to turn your head and don't look
Inside my rhyme book 
You might get your whole soul took 
I make the world shake, I make the world shake 
Then the whole universe quake and then it shook 
Bobby fishy fishy was caught inside my brook 
Daddy caught him with a hook 
Moma fried him in the pan 
And Bobby ate it like a man 
Wu-Tang Clan special brand 
Get the logo 
Bounce on your head with the pogo stick 
Rock the wild horse with the Polo 
Word up we speaking wild 
Quick flash like a photo 
Yea, yea Dorothy you better go find Toto cause we 
ain't in Kansas anymore
It's the killa bee shores, all out war
Before you go here you best to go there 
And see it clear 
Through your third eye 
With a curb, with the high post up most 
Don't play up close
Razor blade technique that strikes you 
Overdose MC's quickly, strictly, hip hoply
You could never stop me, rock me, mock me or pass me 
Cause I'm fast like Kawasaki
And when you see me coming through 
With the vroom vroom vroom 
That means your bitch ass is doomed 
So give me room 
And stand back and hand that mike back to the man Jack 
Unfair black 
I slam that track on trains like Amtrak 
Go to shaolin isle, that's where my fams at
What you doing you can't ripple the gripple son
You get dipped up like Lipton's tea bags
Or you get spit on like the sea hag 
And I smoke a fat tray bag of equality 
Don't bother me
You probably never really heard of B-O-B-B-Y 
D-I-G-T-A-L 
Supreme Clientele served well 
Buh-Bobby fucking up microphones is a hobby 
Buh-Bobby, buh-Bobby, buh-Bobby

I hear the bells 
Can you hear the bells?

Buh-Bobby, fucking up microphones is my hobby 
You get tossed like cracks locked down inside the lobby 
Sucker motherfucker stepped up and tried to rob me for my Cuban link 
What did he think? What did he think? 
What was he thinking? What the fuck was he drinking? 
Bitch you be blast in the head like Abe Lincoln 
Have you whole body shrinking 
Did you believe the killa bees always swarming 
Alarming, calming sound that makes MC's feel how I feel
You best to chill bitch and eat a booger 
Word up or get cut up by the juga 
Razor blade sharp RZA 
Word shame on a nza 
Who try to run game on a nza 
You get broken down like a puzzle with to many equal prisms 
Positions, oppositions 
Here's the transmissions
Word up I raid the phat sample without the glitching 
Why you bitchin'? Why you bitchin'?
Buggin out cause my style it keeps switchin  it keeps switchin
Oh shit I'm itchin  I'm itchin' for a scrap can't catch that
Who could be the match? 
Who wanna match palms? 
I remain calm 
Like the 18 bronze man 
Come to the shaolin chamber of danger feel the anger 
The mad stranger 
Wu-Tang Clan keep a finger 
Tucked inside the back pocket 
Blast like a rocket 
Word up knock your eyes out the socket 
Here's my new topic
I don't give a fuck if you had a whole neck full of garlic
Around you my fangs will puncture your jugular veins 
And you'll be in deep, deep, deep, deep pain
Why oh why oh why do they try?

No hot water or heat, infested with plenty rats  
That'll eat up the average alley cat 
(I'm like damn, homey, thats poverty, he's like)

Where a wicked man, separated the nation  
And got us killin' off one another 
Black on black, they pit brother on brother  
It's gettin' hot, hotter than July 
See the murder and crime rate is risin' to the sky 
(For example, in my neighborhood it's so hot 
I'm often woke up, 
from the alarming sounding of a shot,  
so I'm thinking what) 
Is your neighborhood a trap?  
{Could this be the place marked X on the map?}  
(And I'm spotted like a target in a shooting gallery 
So I strive to seek for a better salary  
So I can escape from where? From this ghetto life area

And I like her verbals,

Her scent was heaven sent  
Offered me a drink,  
beautiful with dead presidents  
A few drinks later,  
we back at her residence  
Surprised, in 35,  
I was deep between her thighs  
When she came, she cried,  
looked me deep in my eyes and said 
Good Night

When I was small 
We had nothing at all 
We used to eat Grits, for dinner 
It was pain 
almost drive a man insane 
what we could find for 
to survive another day 
but I said nah...

An old killa bee once hummed me a tune 
Stay up at night, don't sleep on ya moon
Four seeds in the bed, eight seeds in the room 
Afternoon cartoon, we would fight for the spoon 
Old Earth in the kitchen, yell it\'s time to eat 
Across the foyer, ya hear the gather of stampeding feet 
One pound box of sugar, and a stick of margarine 
A hot pot of Grits got my family from starvin
Loose with the welfare cheese, thick wit' the gravy
used to suck it, straight out the bottle as a baby 
Steamy hot meal serve less than five minutes 
Big silver pot, boilin' water, salt in it
House full of brothers and sisters, the pop's missin

Pillsbury box on the stove in the kitchen

Growin' up, not as fortunate to have that fly shit

You walkin' down the street with ya gun in ya hand
Drinkin, thinkin' of a masterplan
Your Old Earth can't afford what ya friends got
So you roll up to the spot, with ya thing pon cock
And it seems worth the takin  stomach achin
Morning star Reggie makin' go good with the Grits
Now let's take it back for real
when we used to build at ghetto big wheels 
with the shoppin' cart wheels, and wood to nail the seat on
Girls skippin' rope in the street
the Summer heat, left the jelly prints stuck to they feet 
Skelly chief, flippin' baseball cards for keeps
Momma said it's gettin' late, and it's time to come eat

They say wisdom, is the wise words spoken 
By a brother attemptin' to open
The graves, of these mentally dead slaves 
Who've been lost on a cross, for decades
And centuries, lookin' for the liberty
But receive nothin  but misery
And hard times, and things of that nature 
By the devil in a genocide caper 
Little Boy Peep, has lost his sheep 
But I found em, in a deep long sleep
Nine thousand miles away from home 
Livin' the life of a modern-day Flintstone
We the people, supposed to be equal 
But the men who wrote that, they was evil 
Slave owners, who did not include us 
They just used us, and abused us 
First they trick you, then mentally kill you 
And use technologies, to rebuild you 
This whole plan was a perfect scam 
See that's why they called it, the Six Million Dollar Man
Six is the limitation of the Devil 
In the Million square miles of land that he settles

Put you in a three piece suit, give you loot 
Chemicals in your head to make you look cute 
They use you as a fool to deceive your own people 
And fillin' my children head with pins and needles
But I'll take out the pins you inserted
And I'll avenge all my mothers that you murdered
And brutalized, by this modern form of slavery 
To speak the truth it takes bravery 
And no man could stop my flow 
Because I know what I speak and I speak what I know

Who smite with the mighty right hand of God 
Yield the holy sword, swings the holy rod 
Then bathe in the pond of Nirvana, escape the realm of Karma 
Allow the true grace of God to shine through my persona 
And build the reconstructional terms that's constructive
As we destroy the negative germs that's destructive
Productively, sincerely, we uphold the righteous banner 
With the gold touch of Midas, mold the righteous hammer 
And anvil, to the sound of Man-drill 
Ignite to the speed of light cause time to stand still 
Rewrite the script of Egypt, who made the Holy Bible 
Or Koran, how long ago, who made the Holy Title? 
Of I Self Lord And Master, who control the vital 
Parts of your heart, who wrote the wise recitals?

My mic I carry the heat for rappers playin' possum
Fraid that I'm a see em, spit a rhyme, lyrically drop em
Just to say I got em, but it's realer than that
I'm about more that what you see and what I speak in my rap
So be conscious of that 
Grand told you, Watch the quiet ones, you didn\'t get it? 
did it 
Got you open and it worked it and you won't admit it

Yo girl you shinin like a brand new spankin black 
glock  
or a thousand hundred dollar bills inside a shoebox  
Exotic bird, special blend of selected fine herbs  
make me wanna kick my bitch to the curb  
Shaped like a naked statue, but look sacred  
Candy to a baby y'know, I'm ready to take it 
She spread your wings like a peacock  
Girl you be the bomb, and Bobby be shellshocked!  
Behold as I shape and mold your formless globe  
into a perfect O, and breathe the breath of life into 
your nose  
With the fragrance of a fresh pink rose  
and stroll into your eyes, the windows to your soul  
And choose the best part, the dark pupil I chose  
Your heart was mutual, into the center I dove  
Backstroke in your abyss like a fish  
Countin every thought and dream and wish, that exists 
within six  
She was filled with pleasures, of all measures  
But never took the time to discover, her own sunken 
treasure  
Unlock the jewelry box, knowledge rose to the top  
The distilled back in the fine mists, that gave birth 
to the crops  
and seas, that brought us together, for the better  
We could never seperate so maintain your stormy 
weather

You know I fills you, so let my love pass and spill 
through  
your sexual vessels, that bless you then fills you  
up with knowledge and wisdom you understandin  
that bring forth the power refines your whole planet  
She couldn't maintain this heavy slang that I dropped
upon her  
She claimed it never rains, down in Southern 
California  
Bein a black man is most prominant and all dominant  
I couldn't wait to get her home so I could explore her

And put my fountain, between her hills and mountains  
Impingin every square inch of her circumfrence I was 
countin  
Twelve trillion, four hundred and seventy-eight 
billion  
one hundred and eighteen million, four hundred 
thousand ways  
to make children, by buildin

Seven plains of energy, interlace combine  
Five conscious stages, stand up courageous  
Change your plurality, seek mental clarity

Build on today's mathematic ballistics 
I walk with the utmost honorable respect  
It's a quick locked secret, so Protect Ya Neck 
This is full metal jacket, ain't about that gossip 
Nope, you get your face all over the bicep  
Go out the closet, you slimey sausage  
Six degrees of luxury, with no deposit  
They said a friend be sub blanked,

The Zig Zag Zigga, who civilize the wigga

Bytes of information, in one line, how sometime  
Use the sky for a blanket, then I bathe in sunshine  
Nine conquer bonds and nine wives, nine lives  
Nine grands sit on my side, we carry nine knives  
Eighteen strikes from Low Hand, ain't no man 
Can withstand the blow, from the Wu-Tang Clan  
I answer many questions of life, without asking  
Breath in the stench of death, without gasping  
Fasting and praying, while you laughing and playing  
I am fast in my mind, to attachment what we came in  
And go through the river of life, I stay floating  
Live a hundred twenty degrees without quoting

But now I'm reborn to a new chance, a new opportunity 
A life has just begun...  
And if we having a good time, but wasting your time  
Seven plains of energy must interlace and combine  
And all praises due to the Most High...

The technique, depends mainly 
on arm and finger strength 
Once you've that, then the next step
is to learn how to pierce stone 
Well you might as well start practicing now 
Do you-Do you-Do you-Do you 
Do you know, mantis legends? 
How it was it all started? 
It was fighting off this blackbird 
Although it was only a tenth of the bird's size
it was a very valiant insect 
And that's why the technique, needs a brave man
And a strong one, who isn't afraid of birds

bust bullet holes on the chops, I want the number one spot 
With the science, of a giant 
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence 
Silence of the Lambs, o-ccured when I slammed in 
Foes grab their chairs, to be mad as Ralph Cramden 
Others come with shit, as silly as Art Carney 
But my Tetley triplizes, more kids than Barney 
Never need for stress there's three bags of sess
a damn I rest, playing chess, yes 
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn 
When you ain't lookin, I take the queen, with the rook then

Track em through the mud then I bag em 
We're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my balls
and I be raw, for four score plus seven more

Verse Four: Street Thug
Mr. Sandman
 
Yo, watch me bang the headpiece there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal 
murder, underground beef for the burger 
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of 
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, runnin through bitches like Emmitt Smith 
Caution, niggaz best to be careful crossin 
the street, before they end up layin in a coffin 
Don't sleep, niggaz tend to forget, however
Peep this -- my nigga Case lives forever
Mr. Sandman
 
Verse Five: Carlton Fisk
Mr. Sandman
 
What evil lurks in the heart of men? 
It be the shadow, street-life, flowin again 
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure 
Only one kid would knock the hinges off the door 
The jerk tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck 
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec 
Just when I said, Where the fuck\'s the cream? 
Another jerk came out the kitchen with the M-16 
He tried to cock it, blast these shots like, rockets 
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket 
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage 
(The nigga tried to stab you God!) but I dodged it 
Niggaz said, Carlton youse a ill motherfucker 
Cause I made it look like they both killed each other 
And I'm out

B-Bobby, yo 
Hit the bodega for a 40 ounce son, Garcia Vega 
Two bags of chips, and one pack of Now & Laters 
Flame tucked down to my nuts, on my last buck 
Only thing keep a nigga calm is a good f**k 
Loose-leaf cigarettes be dipped in wet 
Chicken of the seas get trapped inside my net 
with their clothes off, son when the gun goes off 
I'm bound to play Napoleon, and blow a nose off -
your Sphinx; your stumble rap style, your flow's off
like Kunta, tryin to run with his chopped toes off 
Unchallenged sword I yield the storm rider 
Clip full of ruffled-tip fast-actin long fire 
Four hundred grain cartridge, with steel casin 
Those who can't draw the crowd is still tracin
The mic is cast to the floor and shapeshifted 
Heavy as the hammer of Thor you can't lift it
So tense, bitch there's no defense
This four-four inch'll make you jump the fence
Right eye squinted; I speak brok-len english 
Stumble off the cold four-oh of Olde English Wu brew 
Two-two inside the shoe 
No describin what this heat, in my jacket could do 
I teach, seeds to read, never reach for the weed indeed 
Bow down to the great Bob Digi Digi

Must Be Bobby
 
Sit in the sun six hours then I charge up like Goku
Must Be Bobby
 
Dragonball Z; imagine you're raggin me
That's like walkin through a Blood hood flaggin a C
Not, tryin to tell you how much weight we carry 
It may get, every snake in the tri-state buried 
Plus, Feds had one add, sayin I gun traffed 
I sold twenty million records bitch; some laugh! 
Fresh shafts of morning dew on Nancy Drew 
Sherlock Holmes crime sleuth couldn't figure the Wu
You loaf of bread head, keep a sober head 
One point five million years my overhead

I keep MC's puzzled keep my dogs in the muzzle
Ice cold forty ounce drink em down with one guzzle
Son might spit a word at a bird, see if she chirp back 
Tall chocolate deluxe buttercup, off the meat rack 
A chickenhead scratch the yard for worms 
And roosters walk around with their heads in the perm 
I be spreadin knowledge keepin my third eye polished 
Never, chase for dollars to fulfill the black wallet 
You must be Bellevue son I walk with twelve jewels 
Afford anything this world could sell you

Changin' his thoughts, standin' on his truth of square

Build it better himself to those around him 
And he start talkin like this... 
Hungry men have no respect for law or authority 
Or human life, a man's bread and butter is only insured if he works for it
Leadership means everything, pain, blood and death 
What night is to day, man is to woman 
And woman is to man, fear is the state of nervousness 
Only fit for children, not men 
All men are created equal, so to offend man, is to offend God 
Fear is lose control of one third, if you become like a helpless deer 
Or a feathless bird, we stand as the true of living, living true 
And these jewels, thoughts of great wise men, like Marcus Garvey 
Start to build up inside Bobby's head
And it lead him to the knowledge of himself 
And he became a strong muthaf**ka!

Mr. Wilson! 
Good morning innkeeper! Two beers for two weary travelers 
I love you Django 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell you think you doing, boy? 
I love you Django 
Get that nigger out of here! 
Where life has little value, prepare the death 
I love you Django 
Another day, another death 
I love you Django 
Another dollar
Ode To Django (The D is silent)
 
RZA: 
He who go through snow, rain, mountain or ice 
Nothing can block ya, this path of vengeance 
There's no repenting, he came to deliver
Out the death sentence, on enemies 
Blood stains on the cotton field by the cotton mill 
Cold steel keep the body hot, they rot in hell 
36 lashes on his back, left gashes 
Every crack of the whip, he got mental flashes 
They interrupt his baby making, and his lady's taken
To a far off place, more north and more forsaken 
Lord help these fools, they be dead man 
Bout to put a third hole in their Klan headbands 
The good Dr. Schultz check their dental records 
The slug make his whole mug disconnected 
They learn to shoot, doing the dead man tango 
He's wild like a wild durango
But the D is silent, Django
Ode To Django (The D is silent)
 
Django, I think you should make a last request 
I\'m going to find you anyway I can 
They praying to kill, I don\'t mind 
It\'s a smart thing to do when you know that death is coming for you 
How come you haven\'t got your burial suit with you? 
We\'ll have to leave you to the vultures
Ode To Django (The D is silent)
 
RZA: 
He get Cash Rule to blast you 
Tie you up, have you hung from his lasso 
And drag you through the valley of death like ruined cattle 
The D is silent, hear the noise from his barrel 
Learned to shoot and do the dead man tango 
Wild like a durango, but the D is silent, Django 
Tie you up, have you hung from the lasso 
Give him a gun, and he gets paid just to blast you 
Drag you through the valley of death, like ruined cattle 
The D is silent, hear the noise from the barrel 
And whistle of the song, like a fucking carol 
In the eyes of the sparrow 
Every father would love to overthrow a tyrant 
It's a simple science, Jack overthrows the giant
Neither snow, rain, mountain or ice can block my path of vengeance 
There's no repenting, I'm giving you the death sentence
Blood stains on the cotton field, in the cotton mill 
Cold steel heat your body up, may you rot in hell 
36 lashes, on my back, left gashes 
For every crack of the whip, I felt mental flashes 
Interrupt my baby making, have my ladies taken 
To a place far up north and more forsaken 
Lord, help this fool he's a dead man
Bout to put another hole in his Klan headband 
The good Dr. Schultz check the dental records 
The slug'll make his whole mug disconnected

Ode To Django (The D is silent)
 
Yeah, his name is Django 
I love you Django 
Django, I think you should make a last request 
I love you Django 
I\'ll be glad to oblige you, anyway I can 
You can start praying if you like, I don\'t mind 
It\'s a smart thing to do when you know that death is coming for you 
I love you Django 
How come you haven\'t got your burial suit with ya 
We\'ll have you leave you to the vultures 
I love you Django 
Where life has little value, prepare the death 
I love you Django

"Ode to O-Ren Ishii
 
Aiyo, I wanna dedicate this song right here to O-Ren Ishii 
Half Chinese/Half Japane-see, Half American and yo 
Oh what a specie, a feminine perfection 
She got the sinister cat eyes and little freckles on her complexion 
Cheaper than Yakuza, but she's wicked like Medusa
And she got Crazy 88 killers that'll slice right through ya
Quick to chop a head off then wipe the blood off 
A long range sniper shot she bust, never let a dud off 
You got a minute to pray and a second to die 
You can see the image of the devil reflectin' inside her eye
But since she was a little girl, yo, she never would cry 
She seen so much tragedy, let me explain to you why 
She grew up on the military base, where she had to face 
The brutality of her mother and her father being erased 
The blood drops from her tear drops, on her face you see the smear spots

Verse One: 
Time is moving slow, life is a drag 
This money to make ya, more girls to bag 
Fully aware, so I step upon the square 
Lookin for what? The cooty and the chair 
Flex and I flex on the opposite sex 
Hit em off quick and step to the next
It's seems I'm a feem for a sex routine
Love to hear them scream 
(Woman: Ohh Rakeem) 
And my response is Oh 
Always satisfy them, you know how I flow 
But since I'm not lazy, I'm buck wild and crazy
I kiss the bussom, but never eat the daisies 
And my ladies love me deeply 
Because I'm handsome, charming and freaky
And when they need me, they won't go
And now I'm stuck, I should of said no
Ohh, We Love You Rakeem
 
Chorus 2: 
Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem 
Rakeem: And I love you to

Verse Two: 
When I walk down the block 
The girls stop and glock 
They hop on my jock 
Cause I got mad props 
Tall & slim with the brown skin conflection 
Half them sweating my love and affection 
As I collect them, I must wan't to protect them
Love them deeply, but never disrespect them 
I keep a tab on the large amount 
But sometimes I find myself losing count 
Of Latika, Diane, Lisa 
Stephanie, Jackie, Teresa 
Sharonda, um um, Veronica 
Latasha, Sinthia & Monica 
Never the less, you must give respect 
To the femine queens that the God selects 
I love them all, but even though 
I'm rather happy, I should of said no
But yet my ego gets in the way 
And always something that I'll never say
I'd just bag them, keep em under my wing
Put them in a posse, and et them sing
Ohh, We Love You Rakeem
 
Chorus 2(Rakeem saying these lines instead) 
Do you 
Say it again baby 
Yes I like it 
Come on you can say it louder

"Passaporto Per Resistere
 
Ciao, ciao, ciao 
Caro RZA qui la storia è tesa 
Potersi esprimere sta diventando un'impresa, o meglio
Passaporto Per Resistere
 
Poterlo fare liberi da vincoli politici 
Senza assecondare orrendi gusti estetici 
Appena fuori standard ti senti solo dire 
Di essere troppo all'avanguardia e quindi incollocabile
Passaporto Per Resistere
 
Fuori tempo minimo per essere comprensibile 
Condannato alla gavetta eterna a raccattare briciole 
Per semplice che sia RZA mio, credimi 
Sono anni che va avanti questo gioco degli screditi 
Dei titoli assegnati senza meriti 
Da chi il fischio d'arbitro la vinto ad una lottery
Passaporto Per Resistere
 
Troppi incompetenti nelle posizioni cardine 
Troppe le barriere che si alzano ad un ordine 
Troppi quei sorrisi a mascherare I modi barbari 
Troppe le energie necessarie ad esser liberi
Passaporto Per Resistere

E questo basta!

Si insinuano negli intestini artistici di direttori stitici 
Avanzano con moti di rivolta peristaltici

Risalgono alla volta dello stomaco 
Altamente indigeribili si insediano 
Aprendo ulcere profonde come gole
Passaporto Per Resistere
 
Urlandoci parole fino a farle traboccare 
Volando in un conato salvatore a metà della riunione 
Ma dimmi, ti pare giusto RZA? Che si debba fare questa cosa 
Ogni volta che uno si riposa? 
Dopo aver provato a dare il meglio 
Dopo avere fatto un altro figlio 
Vederselo strappare da chirurghi dilettanti allo sbaraglio 
Che se commettono uno sbaglio capita

Fanno una modifica e il tempo si decapita 
Non versano una lacrima, bacio all'anima

won't even blink about it

concealing my jammy  
Hoping, I got smoked out  
and broke like Sammy  
Spent the wheel of fortune  
then get struck wit a whammy  
Never that, black,

Yo,yo Hailin from the slums of Shaolin, golden claw,talon twirl 
and one swirl of the fatal sword splits your Island 
WU killa bees stingers back on the swarm again 
zzzzzz,the alarm again, six direction weapon deflection 
Bones connect like opposite sides of magnets 
Steel fragments bein chipped off a singing sword slash 
with the force of big crash in your dash board with no airbag 
He drove a ninety nine Jaguar quick to pick a lock, lick a shot 
Respect the bloods and crips a lot 
Plus the god from ride saggin in his seat, blastin WU beats tryin 
to plot his next hit 
He took a drag of the eight elements that composed,atmospheric gas 
Bout to let off his sword, and full blast kept his mind focused, 
meditation position half lotus 
ABBOT's sword novas couldn't match his magnum opus deluxe stroke,
son move like a ghost 
struck in an instance, unnoticed like a lamp post 
Radar sharp precision gunfire,explode till his clips unload, 
it's a samurai code

Crept in silent, the steel wind 
Chrome silencers screwed on tight kept the gunshots just sealed in 
We attack,full fledge 
with Chicago Bull red bandanas tied tight around our heads 
Swing with the force of a sledge 
Single-edge stainless steel blade chopped the wedge

he could go against the truth and the gods and fall back? 
from the will of Allah, you'll be facin the firing squad

"See The Joy
 
See the joy of life beginning 
See the joy of life beginning 
Oh sweet joy! 
A brand new baby boy
See The Joy
 
[RZA
 
My mind flashed back to the early moon 
When I was just a sperm cell in the fallopian tube 
In the mist of a state of triple darkness 
Going through a struggle so I could exist 
Avoiding everything that came within my path 
As I watch other sperm cells get ripped in half 
One out of a million completes the job 
And for the other sperm cells the womb is a grave yard 
Though my travels I had to pass through 
Alot of battles and violent hassles 
Cause inside the womb I was a foreign object 
I'm like a new nigga walking through the project
Trouble, everywhere I turn 
Damn its a struggle just being a sperm 
cell, so I attempt to prevail
See The Joy
 
I guess the womb is the first stage of hell 
Now here I am in the danger zone 
My head and my tail, my 23 chromosomes 
But then again yo it can't be that bad cause my dad
He could have used a body bag 
And if so then my tomb would have been the trash can inside my moms bedroom 
But they was f**king, they was true to this 
And here a go on a mission to the uterus 
A million mother f**kers tried to race ahead 
But I was the one that fertilized the egg 
Then I thought then I was safe 
Because I reached home base 
But oh no my job wasn't done
In fact my troubles had only begun life as a struggle 
Life is the struggle 
Life is the struggle
See The Joy
 
See the joy of life beginning 
See the joy of life beginning 
Oh sweet joy! 
A brand new baby boy

Un sac de croix sur l'dos j'affronte ces foudres pret à en découdre
Tout blanc vetu, moi le sale noir, l'esprit nue
Seul sur le ring sous le sol spacial, entends la cloche fatale 
Quand les anges ont la dale, c'est mieux qu'un blanc qui sale
Seul Face A Lui
 
Faut que j'sorte du bétail où j'traine ma vie animale
Ca fait un bail que j'danse avec l'espoir
Outre les raisons, seul dans les choix et actions 
Et trop de souvenirs en tete, est-je pris les bonnes décisions? 
C'est dans la pulsion souvent qu'jai choisi la friction
Mais bon... Franchement ya des cons sur Terre qui méritent sanction 
Et tout ce que j'aurais pu dire et faire, ouais je sais j'espère
Veinement qu'les impairs y'a que moi qui va devoir les payer
Seul Face A Lui
 
Et si tu laisses en fait les memes parfaits, ton peuple il va faire les jetés 
Et j'ai bien essayer, tu peux me rayer d'ta liste si ca t'plais
Ni l'moins bon, ni l'meilleur vécu à cent à l'heure
La peur sur le front, le coeur qui fait front comme mon père le fit 
L'Nez collé à l'envie, j'ai fais ce qui fallait
J'te le dis en face, c'était ca ou m'affolé
On peut pas toute sa vie cavaler au campement

Se sont couvert de la misère dans les flashs

No light because the sky was gray 
But I was looking dope if I must so (You can say so) 
But my gear was in it like Prego 
And as I walk I saw up ahead of me a girl 
Eyes gray green like a pedigree 
And then and now I didn't want to pass that
I gave an eye so I could sweat her assests 
She essential influential body potential 
So another lover tied into 
Yo but not a moment to waste 
I slide over like I was flying the whole thing 
Yes I was successful 
Using my special 
Wu-Tang slang that capture the brain 
Next step was yes yep 
Not to disrespect (Nope) 
But I must protect my rep (You got to) 
And after here I told her to entice me 
She said it's too late cause she was a wify
I said, Listen baby check it 
It's one or the other
Lier lover sucker or f**ker 
And guess which choice she chose? (Which one) 
A brother had her lying in my bed with no clothes 
And the Ra was all eyeing her 
But you can save that nicey shit for your mama

And she sounds like cats in over...(Growl)

who shunt all evil, treat all men equal 
Even though we see through your wicked intentions 
We gave you land to experiment with your inventions 
But you strive for global lynchin  extension
But it's yourself that will become extinct
You inherit this power to think and build things 
The free wills of love, not hate or kill things 
And when you went astray, we sent prophets to reveal things 
And left scriptures behind to fulfill things
Sickness
 
But you still wanna kill things, rob and steal things 
So don't blame us when it's time to fulfill things and kill Kings
Sickness
 
[Break: RZA
 
Raise the sword and praise the Lord 
On this wicked society, society 
Raise your sword and praise the Lord 
It's a wicked society, society
Praise the Lord and raise your sword 
Against this wicked society 
Rage the war 
Against this wicked society

Brown bags got more seeds than a cantaloupe 
Northern Lights have you runnin like wild antelopes 
Seen through a microscope, crystallized T.H.C.

"Take The Sword Part III
 
(feat. Leggezin, Crisis, Christbearer, Monk, Tre Irie)
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Intro: kung fu samples
 
Take the sword!  
The sword?  
Come on, give me the sword!  
You Wu-Tang... 
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Dexter Wiggles:
 
Yo... here come the enemy 
And what stands, and we will take... 
For sure, the Lion of Judah stands within the way 
Ready for the voices, to call out the other 
Beware of the storm...
Take The Sword Part III
 
[60 Second Assassin:
 
Our opponents upon the threat with the mighty Gigantor 
I'm rippin' this shit to pieces like Skeletor
The editor, senator of all rap, competitors 
Get this job done on the mic quicker than - 
Financial or power, I attack with the sunshower 
Get the new pres  the taste of God's power
Raining for forty days, burning for forty nights 
Meteoroligists don't even pick up from the satelline
Coming a catastrophe, death of another M.C. 
Killed by the legendary G-O-D, as in me 
Now rest in peace, six feet beneath, subconsciously 
Periodically, and wake up and be somebody 
I swam the shores and cause the laws and I recall 
The rise and fall, but now see I walk tall 
Never needed a slugger, my rapping's like the mugging
I rough up then tough up, I leave your shit left for supper 
Hush up your busted, you can't be trusted
Give me a break out there, foolin' the puppet
On with the subject, cause I'm tired of hearing this rubbish
Now get your stinking breath off the mic
Take The Sword Part III
 
I have nothing but admiration for having foreseen the attack
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Leggezin Fin rappin' in foreign language

Take The Sword Part III
 
[Leggezin Fin:
 
We had 30 years of war, live hardcore 
For our souls through the sky, alotta soldiers died 
You can't ever be denied when, words are only option
Before you close an eye, guarantee you'll be poppin
Ninety-nine percent, muthafuckas straight dropping 
Leaders get starting, AK's, ASK's
With the magazine that say, real Leggezin 
Aiyo, that's what I mean, people pray for the day
Of a good well being, man cry in your genes 
If you steppin' cleans, enemies gettin' low
So he spy enemies, gather fake shit, counterfeit 
Try to make a profit, still I crimes up for the rise 
To the market, so many people starving, die for nothing 
I bring you little something, keep the streets bumping 
Love forever
Take The Sword Part III
 
Take the sword!  
The sword?  
Come on, give me the sword!  
I have nothing but admiration for having foreseen the attack 
You Wu-Tang... 
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Crisis:
 
Who serving us? The Knights is superb with this 
We lyrical murderers, your nervousness got you shaking like turbulence 
The game need nourishment, so we came to nourish it 
Give you lames encouragement, just the name get perished quick 
Black Knights, we far from good samaritans 
Keep the crowd rocking, you keep em nodding like heroine
In the veins of an addict, disrespect, brains'll get splattered
You strained from being subtracted, inflicting pain is a habit 
Killa Cali mentality, rob & sell drugs for a salary 
Niggas can't handle me, bring static like Channel 3
On the M-I-C, or on the streets leave you like Can it Be 
You got served by my first verse, for living in a fantasy 
Yessir, like my nigga Pharell, for real 
Niggas get killed, Black Knights, we destroy then build
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Christbearer
 
Yeah, I make it all seem so simple 
Rock the mic with my quintessential, fundamental 
Killing them off, Christbearer the boss 
The young Rick Ross on the freeway, yeah 
I see the rats run the relay 
Yeah, the judge, the jury, the prosecutor, the DEA 
Yeah, Christbearer, he say 
And he's an O.G. when he flex it, like it's suppose to be
The freestyle champ, keep it amped 
Then, nobody in the camp gets served 
When I swerve, Christbearer the king, I bring 
The, fire, the rain, I touch em, insane
So psycho, yeah, I'm in the PJ's
In the projects, I go, insane
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Rugged Monk:
 
Monk spit fact not fiction, my written is too forbidden 
It be touched, to even bitten, you wack niggas submitting 
Spit darts, rap it so accurate, pierce right through your hollow bones 
Graphic clones, couldn't see me on the microphone
Pen and pad, line for line, bar for bar, you take a choice 
Your courage is flattering, but your need couldn't come close
To the Rugged M-O-N-K, vivid lyrical wordplay 
Display a chamber of rhymes, you couldn't match on your best day
I leave that ass wet like a dolphin, laid in a coffin 
Compton's where I come from, and shit happen's often
What you know about a nigga dying, for natural causes 
He got, hit in his neck, now that's natural for flossing
Even my girl say I'm stuck in my ways
Ever since back in the days, been thugging, dumping with K's
And I'm still at it, still slinging, word to them crack addicts
Still acting, still quick to keep the beef cracking
Take The Sword Part III
 
[5 Foot Hyper Sniper:
 
My dosage of murder is a movie 
3000 Miles to Graceland, alotta gun clapping, man 
Chicks say Dre Street, the last man, specialist, man 
I represents a crime family, nominated for Grammy's
Brooklyn Zu, up in the casino, chips like Bingo 
Flights to Reno, my team's source' like Benzino
You supreme  we got clientele  more kings in jail
We so dangerous, we don't get bail
Judge wanna, let me rot in the cell 
I got to escape like Alcatraz, I be on the run like Ol' Dirty Bast
With a suitcase full of cash, royalties ever stash 
And I got dough from paid shows 
Like uptown, and Tonight at the Apollo 
Dre Street, a tough act to follow, jumped out the Silverado 
Fuck the fifty talent, ahh, bullets flying through the air 
Like spirals on a football, like it was thrown by Brett Favre
Take The Sword Part III
 
Take the sword! 
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Beretta 9:
 
You should pray that I climb the ladder, instead of waving the wand 
Having to abracadabra, he is no longer with us 
I couldn't be any gladder, like the kid on Christmas
Who couldn't be any badder, got everything that I asked for
Including the six shooter, gloves with the hat and mask 
And you was giving it up so, no reason to ask 
And we be living it up, future, present and past 
A bit of pimp in my strut, make it like I got class 
Wine in the wine glass, fine bitch with a fine ass 
And her friend too, the evil that men do 
Just cause I got cash, will I figure I take two 
Or maybe three of those, how we treat them hoes
Take The Sword Part III
 
Take the sword!  
The sword?  
Come on, give me the sword!  
You Wu-Tang... 
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Interlude: sample
 
One hundred men co-operate to save ten lives 
And ten men save one life and death 
That has always been the way of the 108 Dragons
Take The Sword Part III
 
[The Reverend William Burk:
 
Take your plan back to the drawing board, sharpen your sword 
Give your soul back to the church, son, give it back to the lord 
Take your plan back to the drawing board, sharpen your sword 
Give your soul back to the church, give it back to the lord 
You playing with them rooks, knights, bishops, kings 
Queens, bishops, knights, rooks 
Knowledge equal pawns, frontlines, jagged hooks 
Gold shields, illest crooks for the boldest juks 
We eating soul food, cooked good, now what's it shook
It took for one to see the pork without the pieces on it 
It takes for one to grab the cross as if it's Jesus on it
It take for one to see the poor pit with the preacher's on it
It take for one to hear the system with no speakers on it 
And still know that it's all there with the features on it
Like them Cadillacs with woofers and them tweeters on it 
We in stadiums, the floors and the bleachers want it 
In high school I even had my women teachers on it
Take The Sword Part III
 
[RZA:
 
We keep diamonds in small packets like sunflower seeds 
When my glock get a cold, it throws a gunpowder sneeze 
Achoo, blow a fever at you non believers 
I bet your cornerback won't intercept the receiver
Of this hundred meter bullet, trigger pull back when I pull it 
A quarter inch, I clear the whole bench, I clear the whole field 
And the building, your boy Bobby Steels been 
Trapped in the projects, playing spades with the pilgrims 
Now Im back on O-R, aiyo, pa 
The glock goes pop pop, now it's back tok the Alamo
Take The Sword Part III
 
I have nothing but admiration for having foreseen the attack, now 
Because of it...  
Take the sword!  
The sword?  
Come on, give me the sword
Take The Sword Part III
 
[Outro: sample
 
When a man wants to attract the female 
The best way is to apply a musk perfume 
But when a man uses a musk perfume 
There are two important things he must be aware of 
One; is that he will get the woman he wants 
Even if she woudln't ordinarily succumb to his charms
The other is that his own special odor, his body's natural smell
Will change... 
The very demon of revenge seeks divine guidance? 
Haha, do you really think you can absolve yourself from sin? 
By sculpting, stupid little toys? 
Who-ho, now that's some shit you don't see everyday
You've fallen so far, coward
I've been watching you, can you even raise your sword?
Against another, where's the cold blooded killer, you once were
Do you no longer have the stomach to fight? 
Will you remain a coward, even as your father suffers? 
Oh, now, that just ain't nice
You don't have to listen to that shit
And you have such a long long way to go 
To save your poor tortured father 
I've almost revived his rotten bones
Oh he will live again, to feel pain 
To suffer, and you don't even have the number two headband yet
So I have a few more days, or maybe even weeks 
To enjoy your father's pain
Before you even have the right to challenge me 
Watch

Bear-hug a grizzly, suck milk from her titty 
Take the Sergeant's hat from his head and use it for a frisbee
Spit in the crocodile face 
Have a ménage à trois with two female apes 
Then sleep in a barrel of butcher knives

Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt naked!

Yo I smell smoke, I hope my engine ain't on fire
Pulled off the road, hope this damn truck won't explode
Felt like a scene from the last James Bond episode 
Drivin sixty miles per hour through weed trees and dead flowers 
Bust the overdrive, couldn't control the power
Pushin through bushes, mud, bugs 
Covered the front and back windshield like carwash suds 
I couldn't see, I knew these niggaz was gainin on me
I tried to bust a 360, I crashed into a tree 
It felt like a bulldozer, knocked my ass over 
I fell out the Rover, grabbed the briefcase ran over 
to a log cabin, had a sign posted DO NOT ENTER 
I bust through the door my body got cut up with splinters 
I ain't give a F**K, tryin to find somewhere to duck
Ahh, ahh, uhhhhh, ahh 
and catch my breath, count how many shots I had left 
My clip was full, the first nigga walk through I'm gonna pull
It was Ivan Korlof, he came through with a sawed off 
Bust the cannon shot and tore the rest of the f**kin door off
The Chase
 
Burst, break, run, jet, flee, boogey, move, be audi 
Slide, duck, dip, bounce, be ghost, escape, blazini, poof 
The Genie, disappear, cast out like they ain't seen me
Killer Bee, fast lamborghini 
(repeat 2X)
The Chase
 
Junk turned fragments scattered in all direction 
One grazed me, on my kneecap but didn't faze me
Count to three, jumped up, I fired back 
My four-four snub slug, dug a hole in his head 
like Dig Dug, partner crashes in 
with the infrared precision shots, just missin 
Night vision goggles, shit had me boggled 
Forty-Four mag, was too much to swallow 
Held the briefcase in front of my face, jumped through the window 
Daring, got up and went like Dr. Kimball
The Chase
 
I burst, broke, ran, jetted, fleed, boogied, moved, was audi 
Slid, ducked, dipped, bounced, ghost, escaped, blazini, poof 
The Genie, disappear, niggaz out like they ain't seen me
Killer Bee move with the speed of lamborghini

Fatal guillotine's took flight, snatch heads, brought them back
Before they can blast, one gun, half a cal., he was done 
One fourth was blinded by reflection of the sunlight 
Off the shield, the golden blade, golden wheel 
Five element ninja was patrollin' the hill
The enemy face defeat, the reminder of his fleet tried to retreat 
To the mountain side, it was countin' on a cage for a safe place to hide
Location was lurked about, brought turned about 
Called the men, burned them out 
Capture up theire leader, made em stiff like an ameba
Broke his bat like semi cheeba 
Stuck on poodle, we hold weight like a sumo 
Great, fast, like Bruno Sammartino

Then penetrate, ya bodies five major gates 
The pulsatin' beat vibrates, and yo thighs shake
You fruitcake, little tiny small molecular 
Miniature, minute, itty bitty, microscopic

Wild savage, but he bow down to his master 
Wash it down with a ice cold Shasta, he would shout
Unleash Me
 
[Chorus: RZA
 
I am free from you, so unleash me 
There's nothin' else you can do to teach me
Nothin' else you can do to appease me
I know this point in life, it wouldn't be easy
I gave you my all, I would eat food 
Out of cans, with my hands and all 
Just to show and prove, you my man's and all
Didn't even try to make plans at all
Unleash Me
 
[Prodigal Sunn
 
My hand's cut in the outer, leakin' the contender
Hit em high, stick em low, break through the center
Somebody screamin' ambulance, yo, he bend a
Ghost like a ninja, whole nother agenda
Yes, we day and night, ready for fight 
Plus I spit more through the mic, four fist right 
Chest, head, body blow, would leave, anything goes 
Broken nose, shatterin' jaws, spark him with the C-4
P-Sunn did it from the east door 
The more I tour, the more I score, watch the lion roar 
Through the field, with the skills and agility 
Martial art ability, bend the laws of gravity 
Stay in shape, no cavities 
Some wise words from a young one, trained to reach mastery
Unleash Me
 
[Chorus: RZA
 
I am free from you, so unleash me 
There's nothin' else you can do to teach me
Unleash Me
 
[Christ Bearer
 
I am free from you, Buddhapest fist, Tai Chi, Kung Fu 
Master sick cool, jujitsu, round house kick you 
Forty elbows, then I left right hit you 
Master set me free, although you'll never let me get the master key
Cause when it's time for beef, who could the master be
While I'm stopped, critique you see the master flee
But cats keep rushin  I'll back flip bust you
Crack your rib cage apart, snatch your heart, that's nothin
Guillotine chop, to the Phillipine hot 
Leave em worst, and sendin' them to Killa, get shot
I ate from my hands, and ate from the plan 
Entranced, my fake was a glance 
I gave you my all, I know you felt my slave to, and thought 
I'm sittin' pool on y'all
Unleash Me
 
[Chorus 2X

Keep a sword tucked sharp inside your personal

Unspoken Word
 
[Bobby Digital
 
Word's on the street Dunn Dunn Bobby's goin Digital
Hoverin the city inside the Wonder Woman's invisible jet
Clouded by the Meth we move undetected 
in secret society sects, NARC's radar
suspected us to be a cumulus cloud, ejectin lightning 
Strikin like a wild knuckle fight, in New Brighton 
A million strands of spider webs weaved to make my vest 
The energy compacted deep within, my inner chest 
One touch of my eagle claw clutch, rips your guts 
Brass head kill you fast with a rapid, head bust 
Ninjas spyin, the ammo flyin, the steel iron 
Blow a nigga neck from his head, like dandelions 
My team is a magazine of M-16's
But we calmly, defeat your army, by blowin steam 
Noisy as a thousand barkin dogs, rap's sweat hogs
Welcome back to the catalogue, hip-hop cyborg 
Bobby Digital, keyboard clogged bitch you analog 
We blowin smoke creatin Scooby Doo fogs 
Escape cell block eight's my tape on the rocks
Sean Connery, calmly bombin MC's, who stuck on my phenomenon
Word up, no hurry up, for the merrier 
You worry Duck, you get touched by the razor cut 
You feel the flurry huh, don't worry yo
You get cut by the razor, yo, yo, yo yoThe Wu rag tied around your head, like a doo rag 
Carry large black guns in small school bags 
Funeral date, will be engraved on the wall, in roman numerals 
The Looney Tune niggaz I be rollin with, be screwin you 
Quick to make a nigga shit in his pants, with one glance 
Laid back like a fat Huffy bike, on the kickstands 
My Clan'll make the most hardrock chump turn to glass
and shatter, leave no traces of your matter 
You kids playin hot feet, wait til you go to sleep I pull your teeth 
I'm vegetarian BITCH, I don't need the beef

My Earth gave birth to the fertile crescent soil 
No time for fragile planet for small wombs 
My dick bust a universe, my nuts weigh a moon, stay in tune 
Champagne thoughts with Bud Light money, blunts dipped in honey 
Digital, make the gloomiest day feel sunny 
Slang slides slashes for him plan record upon the Lord 
Confuse you like a forty-eight track mixboard 
Milli phaser blast a hole in your back the size of moon craters 
These anti-crucified on my Technic crossfader 
F**k the bloodshed, you be leakin your soul

After I pay the tax, I'mma buy us a crib 
In the winter, I'mma buy us a whip 
So we can take long trips, just me and the kids  
I'm up again, I never let you down 
Nothings ever gonna stop me now  
I'm up from the gwop, don't gotta hide from the cops 
Plus homey's got a spot, they can stay off the block 
They can drop a few tracks, or spar a few minds  
The God home from the pen, he left the yard behind  
Got a brand new sampler, take the breaks and I loop it  
Got a license for the gat, in case the public is stupid

Make me weak about the knees,

Or should I kick knowledge,

But take it from me,  
it ain't cool to skip class, imagine it 
Five Gods, came to picture perfect, to ovulate to it  
Music and expression of freedom, escape to it  
Not much to it, we was born and conceived to it  
And me being the man that I am, the same could do it  
Surrounded by a civilized man, a weak woman  
Subconsciously be planting a fed, inside children  
Allow me to explain my cause,

Money, now we taking trips to Jamaica, just to relax  
My homey's came a long way since paper from g-packs 
But gone, they used to be pushing BP's and Zenax 
Now they wire us our paper back and forth like we fax  
We ask the lord and savior for guidance  
It's probably hard to hear us over gunshots and violence 
Figure when I'm in the casket it'll be plenty silence 
So in the end, when you add it up, it all balance  
The crew been up, staying higher than pallets  
On vacations in the islands, watching women with talents  
Fellowship and with the family members who be the wildest  
Now we live in mansions, castles and golden palaces

You ain't sayin' nothing slick to a can of oil
Tell your man to tell his man that his man's a girl
I holds weight, ya'll niggas skinny like Olive Oil
We throws atleast half a ki' in the pot to boil
Royal niggas, rags to riches 
Because your boy breaks bitches like glasses, dishes 
Burn money like I put it in some grass and spliffed it 
If I don't get my man that's passed, it's not misses
Female donkeys, ya'll niggas ass and dickless
Hard white rap, just some foil like chiclets 
Never had a wife, you better settle for the mistress 
The truth like Al Capone dying for the syphlis 
Cross me, you name flying on the hit list 
Ya'll niggas buck, won't even pop a clutch on the gear shift
That ain't the hard pose, nigga, you just scared stiff
I'm on my grizzly, you might walk right into bear shit
You rock your pants too tight, get off that queer shit 
No turning back when it's on, I ain't trynna hear shit

War - is comin' home - takes families
War - I'm not a great big fan of it

Bitches on the fences wonderin what the f**k the suspense is 
I land heavy uppercuts in the corner of the park fences 
Knocked his mouthpiece front teeth got locked inside my knuckle 
He grabbed the belt buckle, attempt to catch me with a couple 
of low blows to the nuts, on ringside was as a giant du-els 
Send your Barb for this f**kin jew On a Wire 
He couldn't chessbox that's when he reached for his ahhs
Brother chopped me on the top of my knot, but he got stopped 
When a twelve ounce bottle of Bartyle and James had him startled 
A bitch threw it caught him in his head, at full throttle 
He fell, the glass crashed, he wasn't saved by the bell
That was his ass black

Fiends know me for my blue bags, besides smackin crabs 
and earnin mine, this bitch Sha cat, gotta get his back bent 
What the hell just made him f**k with my intelligent? 
Back to Polly and I heard some noise we pack a two twelve 
There go Lord Shamel, faggot made a sale 
He's sellin my shit, I should slap fire out his ass
Snap his bones in half and watch the stock market crash 
I walked up on him, he had the nerve to say Peace God 
Ain't nuttin Peace God, you stole it now we out in the streets
Take your shit off, nigga you soft, back up off 
Youse a shady nigga, I'm a sever fig you with a gloss
I snuffed him, threw a crazy left and I cuffed him 
Allah don't like ugly so I held back from bustin him
I passed the burn off, he caught me from the blind side 
Tapped a nigga jaw, I shot my fifty-two style, and crazy raw 
I had my ice on, tapped a few times, he started leakin 
De King with the deadarm, Shamel fell to his knees and 
He started wheezin, losin his breath from smokin trees and 
I'm still breathin, bleedin because it's frontin season
Now I got that project belt, international/national 
Worldwide, I let Shamel slide

Ain't what you want baby

Ain't what you want baby

Wu-wear: The Garment Renaissance
 
Verse One: RZA
Wu-wear: The Garment Renaissance
 
Yo diamond crystal rings sharp like icicles 
nickel plated pistols, official Wu-Wear covers my 
physical 
Insulated thermal while others drain they co four butt 
solos 
Photographic photo type static great motivated soldier 
Or Wu say boulder head flower 
You can detect the true and living God from the scorer 
Keep your sword straight, maintain your weight 
But he ate too much monosodiumglutumate, and 
polysorbate 
And drug rate concentrate, with sodium benzoate 
By the chicken thighs and tryglycerides 
And this bitch advertised her breast size 
Eighty-five didn't realize, til the truth opened up
his eyes 
Then he became highly civilized 
and spent time amongst the wise, went through a 
garment renaissance 
and stopped wearing Benetton 
Tommy Hill, Perry Ellis, Nautica, or Liz Claiborne 
Ocean Pacific, Fila, Bill Blass and leave fitted 
Quit the Armani sweaters with the Gucci wool knitted 
Now all he buys, Kani's, Cross Colours, Shabazz
Brothers 
Mecca, Pelly Pell, 88, North Q, Bear and a few others 
For the new year, strictly Wu-Wear

"You Can't Stop Me Now
 
[Intro: RZA
  
Round up, round up, round up, round up  
Round up, round up, round up, round up... 
You Can't Stop Me Now
 
[Chorus: The Whatnauts  
Message from a Black Man  
sample w/ ODB sample
  
No matter how hard you try,  
you can't stop me now 
No matter how hard you try,  
you can't stop me now 
You Can't Stop Me Now
 
[RZA
  
The greatest B-Boy of all time,  
started from small crimes  
While others had big tops  
I was slingin' small dimes 
Tryin' to make the come up, 
the blow used to numb up  
A few G's a week, 
my clique used to sum up  
Till my brother got locked up,  
my girl got knocked up  
My closest homies each,  
got popped up and shot up  
And cops flood the block, no way to eat  
So I dropped a half a G on a rented SP  
1200 Sampler, and a Yamaha Four-Track  
The bass from the lab used to blow  
the f**kin' door back 
While Ghost was doin' stick-ups, 
tryin' to make a vic' up 
Waitin' outside for the Brinks 
truck to pick up  
Nothing would work,  
so we're back to choppin' nicks up 
Givin' grown ass women 
two vials for a dick suck  
When I was stressed  
I would head to the rest  
Then the pads on the SP-12  
got pressed  
Makin' beats for the streets,
 so the family could eat  
In 93, 
Wu-Tang Clan  
dropped their first LP  
We went platinum, *whoo-peesh*,  
yeah we flatten em 
Pockets got fat and um,  
went and got Cap and em 
Staten's on the map and um, 
Brooklyn Zu is bombin' em 
All around the world,  
Killa Beez start swarmin' em 
You can't stop us, you can't block us 
Rock us or mock us, knock us or top us  
Better sit back and watch us... 
You Can't Stop Me Now
 
[Chorus
 
You Can't Stop Me Now
 
[Inspectah Deck
  
Can't stop me man... 
No matter how hard, you better go hard  
So hard, if you gonna try and stop me now  
I be ruckus to rhythm like the blocks be wild  
Bad enough I got the cops tryin' to lock me down 
Can't nobody break my stride or shake my pride 
Without a homicide, case and trial  
It's a long time comin  long nines bustin' 
Cradle to the grave I be on my grind hustlin' 
Sometimes when I think about it,  
have my mind buggin' 
The shit that I been through,  
things that I've seen 
The chicks that I ran through,  
places I've been 
I'm a victim of the very song I sing 
That's how it is in the heart of it, 
most want no part of it  
Some will soothe the pain  
through booze and narcotics  
I'mma hold my head, stay true 
to where my heart is  
Either you pay with your life,  
or you pay dues and homage 
You Can't Stop Me Now
 
[Chorus 2X

"You'll Never Know
 
One-two, one-two 
Mic check, one-two, one-two (You don't know, that I really love you)
Yo, yo, You'll Never Know
Check me out (You don't know, that I really love you)
Yo, yo, yo
You'll Never Know
 
[RZA
 
I love you like how birds love rose petals, Killarmy love full metal 
I love you like how the Park Hill cats love to pull metal 
The heat will make ya head whistle loud like a full kettle 
I come like the Mecca in civilizin 
The hallway jackal, Chicago Bull bandana 
I keep police scanners from fishes 
They try to slash me out like Douton Hanna 
And blow my spot, yo, I'm not the polka-dot
I tote weight, sip Scotch, bust shots, smoke a lot 
My cousin Billy, he done it silly, used to joke a lot 
Chased bitches, cut class, got high and stayed broke a lot 
So when the rent was due he would grab the identical 
Twin gats and put a f**kin hole in your right ventricle 
Not sober yet no potent threat, yo, I hold a Tec 
Show this jet pack on my back, blast like no respect 
While you bickerin, this flame is still flickerin 
Then the magnetic attraction to my wisdom keeps you listenin
You'll Never Know
 
[Interlude: Cilvaringz
 
Yo, yo 
Choco bang that shit! 
Yeah, yeah (You don't know, that I really love you)
Killa Beez, European 
Yo, yo, shut up!
You'll Never Know
 
[Cilvaringz
 
Eh-yo, my sword so sharp I split the tweeters in ya Genelacs 
European Killa Beez attack, chk-chk-chk 
I never smoke blunts, tote weight, nor bust shots 
But f**k with me I guarantee you'll get ya neck chopped
Be the haunting, dauntin, brothers won't f**k
You'll Never Know
 
with The Wu-Tang swordsman, slowly get dropped 
When my Shaolin sword, swing at Nasty Immigrants with passports 
To teach Man, Woman and Child, with the sword style 
God, complete the presence 
It only takes seconds to chop a nigga head on RZA records 
But you a worthless effort, follow faster then leopards 
I can't wait to return to the f**kin essence
Of hip-hop, yo, my shit chop constantly 
It's over when my shit drops, son, honestly
I love the RZA and the whole Wu Academy 
For givin me a chance to be what I wanna be (What?) 
But You will Never Know how much..
You'll Never Know
 
[RZA
 
Do you think this cocked mic will jam or choke? 
Come on my nigga.. Listen yo.. 
Do you think this black mic will cock back, jam or choke? 
I should stick a long silver hook down your throat 
And snatch out your vocal, bitch my eyes is black opal 
Reflectin this 2.2 kilogram Mac that smoke you 
Firin lightnin, Northern Lights, duck tight and chocolate Philly 
Lyrics pierce through the ear like the spear of Achilles 
Iron body Bobby Digital suit, don't bother to shoot
Quicker than Clint when I draw the six shoo
Mortal Kombat whether it's the blind or the mute
Cripple a idiot, dunn, it sounds ridiculous 
Rapid flow got you petro, my voice echo, echoes 
Off the Wall Street money we stack like golden geckos 
Gecko, gecko, let go my Eggo or feel my Eagle 
4,5,6 in my hand, I've rolled the c-lo
Brother knocked the long pound, ounces or straight kilos 
You know how we go, it's the Killa Bee show
Then I love you like how the pharoah loves Joseph 
The jewelry of Moses, like a man bendin down on one knee before he proposes 
The special 8, laid the hammer, about to slay Isaac 
and the paitence of Daniel in the lion's den with closed eye lids
You'll Never Know, You'll Never Know..
Yo, yo.. here.. (You don't know, that I really love you)
